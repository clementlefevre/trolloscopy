       "[' a hero in greece since he humiliated the nazi occupiers by climbing up the acropolis and tearing down the swastika flag in 1941 the funny thing is no one has ever been able to find any actual historical evidence that glezos and santas removed the flag beyond their own words it s also not entirely clear that when greeks today think of glezos the first thought that comes to mind is hero but the good communist did send his kids to private school i c excuse me but where is the evidence that manolis glezos and apostolos santas removed it apart from their own words you cite newspaper reports that the flag was removed you present no evidence that it was removed by glezos and santas kalidas true but glezos supported the syriza government platform of bringing private schools in greece effectively under the control of the state so does tsipras yet surprisingly sends his own kids to a private nursery school komis why exploiting the sufferings of the greek people under nazi occupation to make a hero of yourself seems more offensive to me for heaven s sake madness although half of them are here either trafficked as girls or immigrants or trafficking as scum bags a ukrainian friend an academic working at an eu schengen area university was asked when she had to go for an interview in order to get a visa to enter the republic of ireland for three days for an academic conference whether had ever been a prostitute because obviously if a woman is ukrainian she must also be treated as a potential prostitute harold godwinson these decisions are not being made behind closed doors these countries have had several years in which to implement the criteria criteria which are known to all and drawn up by the eu member states and institutions if these countries are deemed to have achieved the criteria then the commission will propose that they be granted visa free travel to the schengen region member states and the european parliament will be able to oppose that proposal if they do not feel that these countries do indeed fulfil the criteria as you say this is a schengen issue and does not concern you as such you actually have very little idea of the consultation that actually goes on in the schengen region what do you propose that each schengen country has a referendum icuruscrb did you know that icon of the right viktor orban of hungary has given all hungarians in surrounding countries including serbia and ukraine the right not only to claim a hungarian passport but also to vote in hungarian elections i trust you fired your cleaners once you found out they had duped their way into the uk harold godwinson i am totally opposed to brexit but must agree that such out of the blue announcements with no rationale attached to the decision try my patience in the extreme this is not an out of the blue announcement the procedure for these countries to meet the criteria for visa free schengen entry has being going on for years with extremely stringent criteria just because you live outside the schengen region and hence have no clue what is being discussed inside it doesn t mean that this proposal is out of the blue or with no rationale nespresso pods are not artisan coffee but an abomination to anyone who has any inkling of what a good coffee is eastern european eastern european i couldn t respond to you on the duda thread as it was closed sure poland has attracted much inward investment in recent years but the arrival of duda and an impending pis government with the shift away from a european orientation that might entail and some of their populist economic policies could damage that fiatsceptic why do you bother reading the ft why do european elections concern you rrrahul does your partner agree with you however in any case i thought it was partly the security changes that were passed under sarkozy s presidency that have made it more difficult for the security forces to keep tabs on known extremists and hence also discover who the unknown ones are the one who hits hardest is not always the one that can best deal with an issue often they simply exacerbate a problem it s not women who are wearing burkinis that are the problem more like loser young men who drink and deal drugs and can t do much with their lives so they try and make themselves heroes in another way they re not very pious sarkozy didn t do so well dealing with the disaffected and riotous youth last time he was president i m not sure why he d do any better another time round his hungarian counterpart viktor orban said the outcome of the vote represented a popular rejection of mass migration by a british public trying to take control over its own future britons were seeking an answer to how they can resist modern day migration he told state run kossuth radio about how they can continue to keep their own lives in their own hands yeah the leavers were apparently rejecting mass migration from hungary and other parts of eastern europe captain willard what do you want him to say yes the eu is about to unravel that would be incredibly irresponsible of him aside from being untrue ric because i m british and this has destroyed my country captain willard yes but the brits have always been unhappy with the eu partly because there is still a legacy idea that britain had a great empire and we are so much better than these funny continentals there is a misguided view that complaints about the eu in other countries are for the same reason as those in england but those complaining in greece for example are complaining because there isn t enough integration there aren t things like eurobonds they want more eu money they want more qe for greek banks when the citizens of other countries say they re disappointed with the eu it s often because they don t feel that they are receiving enough money support financial tools integration from the eu not that they want less and juncker is right this vote certainly won t lead to the unravelling of the eu more like the unravelling of the uk once again marine le pen subtly shifts her position from leaving the eu to giving french voters the chance to vote to stay in the eu sarkozy should just go away and let s not forget that jean marie le pen was just re elected as an mep for the front national the party he founded and of which is honorary president helle thorning schmidt danish prime minister how is it possible that a politician from a non eurozone country indeed one with an opt out be considered as a possible commission president especially considering how important the role of the president is for the eurozone only in britain is helle thorning schmidt considered a potential commission president just like only in britain was tony blair s name touted for the same job unintendedconsequence the people who want to break europe are those who encouraged a referendum in the uk and who pushed for a leave result okay2 indeed people always forget or overlook that what germany has been asking for is not austerity but reform the writer is author of the 13th labour of hercules inside the greek crisis oh great another yiannis varoufakis this yiannis also forgets to give an idea of what greece itself needs to do to change or even acknowledges that there s such a need beyond the cliche the politicians were so bad again the answer is other people s money let s not forget greece s debt was run up to pay for its clientist political system and destructive wasteful public sector with intellectuals like this no wonder the country is in a mess yawn the moves echo those of viktor orban the prime minister in neighbouring hungary except poland and hungary do not neighbour on to each other although it s henry foy so this is what we can expect which is why they have better relations than say hungary and slovakia or poland and lithuania do but still even viktor orban is kind of keeping a distance from the kaczynski government quine when talking about countries and geographical regions neighbouring tends to mean adjacent to perhaps in some rare instances it can mean nearby country but this is pretty rare in any case h foy s intention in using the word neighbouring is precisely to show an apparent closeness between poland and hungary the geographical closeness is debatable but the political closeness he is trying to claim would be unlikely to exist if these countries actually neighboured on to each other or bordered if it helps you to understand better because they would be squabbling over past conflicts ms merkel was particularly insistent should would not abide caps on asylum seekers something imposed by neighbouring austria this is a complete misunderstanding of the eu policy according to this policy austria has exceeded the numbers of its quota whereas germany never had a quota as chancellor faymann of austria stated it s time for other eu countries to take in their fair quota share btw what does should would not abide caps mean city slick er yes hollande is doing so well and damn that schaeuble for insisting that southern european countries do things like actually reform so that they have properly functioning economies i have sympathy with the austrian position effectively all they re really trying to do is actually implement the main elements of the general eu policy that has been theoretically approved by capping they are saying other countries should take on their refugee quotas austria has already exceeded its quota numbers and they are also arguing the proper securing of greece and italy s external borders which both countries are still lagging on the austrian foreign minister has consistently said if greece cannot secure its own borders then austria is willing to help yet greece refuses this help i don t think germany particularly cares that it has not been invited given that austria is slowing down flows to them but greece certainly does because their politicians are inept and can only shout more importantly the visegrad 4 have not been invited and how can anyone really talk about the revival of the austro hungarian empire without hungary or the czechs this is definitely a distancing from the awful v4 line nightboat if greece which has repeatedly failed eu security standards on this issue wants to funnel people through to austria then they must assure austria that their security standards are impeccable it s not as though the greek authorities with their supposed experience in patrolling thousands of islands and europe s longest coastline can be said to be doing a good job moreover aside from doing a bad job they are also deliberately trying to send just anyway through whichever country they are from and not attempting to repatriate those from safe countries or economic migrants in short if greece truly believes as it claims that its coasts are not just national coasts but european coasts and that europe should help it then it should accept europe s help in patrolling those coasts and it s not just coasts but also the land once they have already let everyone in hedgeemoneey what does europe mean to you a geographical unit political entity set of values joining together to achieve more than is possible on one s own i guess you think of it as simply a geographical unit with some common history vox rationalis except there is no such thing as this alternative group of countries and certainly no other countries in the eu looking to the uk for any kind of leadership over them have you noticed how these allies cameron used to talk about haven t emerged or how none of the other countries that aren t yet in the eurozone talk about forming a separate group together st andrean except as part of the hanseatic league hamburg flourished and had much stronger trade and other links with the other members of the hanseatic league than it did with england messenger not as awkward as it will be for the people of england if they find themselves outside of the eu vectis we are one of the world s largest and most successful economies so what s the problem then the uk is doing extremely well in the eu eu membership has been good for the eu the fact is that it s precisely because the uk is in the eu that it s one of the world s largest and most successful economies if you want england to remain successful then vote to stay in the eu just saying most of the overworked in the nhs are migrants and often not from the eu i wonder how overworked nhs staff would feel if you took out all the migrant workers from it chamberlain how about the uk have the same provisions as the rest of the eu no receipts until you ve made a certain level of contributions that would deal with some of the complaints against indigenous scroungers too more to the point how many polish families have actually turned up from warsaw in the uk homeless with a family and in need of medical treatment and then expected the british state to pay for them i suspect none mr tusk et al aren t instructing the uk how to conduct its arrangements just pointing out that if the uk is going to remain in the eu then it has to follow the eu regulations that it has already in fact taken part in negotiating and already agreed to if the uk doesn t like following eu regulations then it can just leave watt the schengen area is also similar to what the uk and republic of ireland have imagine how much hassle and extra costs would be created if passport free travel didn t exist on the uk irish border omnibus but most of the rest of the eu are in and want to be in judyw boot out brits living in the eu cut off access to the single market have the uk lose even more influence in eu decision making bodies have the uk lose workers from the eu because it is an unfriendly place which means fewer skilled eu workers in the uk refuse to cooperate with the uk leading to its withdrawal from the eu besides exactly who are all the unemployed eu folks living on uk benefits and how much tax have they paid it s a pretty disingenuous stereotype that she s playing on of course judy would fall for it judyw schengen law is nothing to do with residency or benefits or asylum you are so clueless it s laughable and stop telling us europeans what to do with our continent perhaps you ought to save your energies for campaigning for tighter gun laws in your own country or something rational like that i wonder what martin sandbu thinks of the findings of the greek parliament s truth committee on the greek public debt which was established with much fanfare headed by alexis tsipras personal choice for speaker of the greek parliament zoe konstantopoulou she was elected to the position with the highest votes ever for a speaker the extract below is the conclusion to the preliminary findings realised on 17 june 2015 the committee has its own webpage but it s so badly designed i too the extract from this link http cadtm org executive summary of the reportchapter 9 legal foundations for repudiation and suspension of the greek sovereign debt presents the options concerning the cancellation of debt and especially the conditions under which a sovereign state can exercise the right to unilateral act of repudiation or suspension of the payment of debt under international law several legal arguments permit a state to unilaterally repudiate its illegal odious and illegitimate debt in the greek case such a unilateral act may be based on the following arguments the bad faith of the creditors that pushed greece to violate national law and international obligations related to human rights preeminence of human rights over agreements such as those signed by previous governments with creditors or the troika coercion unfair terms flagrantly violating greek sovereignty and violating the constitution and finally the right recognized in international law for a state to take countermeasures against illegal acts by its creditors which purposefully damage its fiscal sovereignty oblige it to assume odious illegal and illegitimate debt violate economic self determination and fundamental human rights as far as unsustainable debt is concerned every state is legally entitled to invoke necessity in exceptional situations in order to safeguard those essential interests threatened by a grave and imminent peril in such a situation the state may be dispensed from the fulfilment of those international obligations that augment the peril as is the case with outstanding loan contracts finally states have the right to declare themselves unilaterally insolvent where the servicing of their debt is unsustainable in which case they commit no wrongful act and hence bear no liability people s dignity is worth more than illegal illegitimate odious and unsustainable debthaving concluded a preliminary investigation the committee considers that greece has been and still is the victim of an attack premeditated and organized by the international monetary fund the european central bank and the european commission this violent illegal and immoral mission aimed exclusively at shifting private debt onto the public sector making this preliminary report available to the greek authorities and the greek people the committee considers to have fulfilled the first part of its mission as defined in the decision of the president of parliament of 4 april 2015 the committee hopes that the report will be a useful tool for those who want to exit the destructive logic of austerity and stand up for what is endangered today human rights democracy peoples dignity and the future of generations to come in response to those who impose unjust measures the greek people might invoke what thucydides mentioned about the constitution of the athenian people as for the name it is called a democracy for the administration is run with a view to the interests of the many not of the few pericles funeral oration in the speech from thucydides history of the peloponnesian war sun carriage it doesn t matter what you would choose the imf isn t trying to be independent it already is it doesn t need to try to be in fact the imf doesn t need to be involved in the greek bailout at all the greek government certainly doesn t want it to be the reason the imf is involved in the greek bailout is because the eurozone in particular the german government want it to be this is because imf rules are particularly strict and having them involved will make it more difficult for greeks to squirm out of what needs to be done to fix the greek economy god knows they ve been trying hard enough the imf also has stricter rules about debt levels and sustainability as lagarde has said since the new greek government came in greek debt has shot up and is now unsustainable according to imf standards imf rules state that a country s debt must be sustainable according to very strict criteria of what sustainable is because some of the non western countries of the imf are a bit fed up of the greek bailout saga and also because western domination over the imf and other international organisations is under question by emerging economies lagarde has to make the right sounds to keep them satisfied there will be significant debt relief tied to reforms the imf will stay involved the greek government will have to reform greece seriously this time nothing to do with whatever el erian thinks is going on the imf isn t even asking for any new reforms or a so called pro growth agenda it s simply asking the greek government to do what the country agreed to do back in 2010 but still hasn t yet done sun carriage good for mohamed el erian yet again he shows very little knowledge of the actual politics of the situation or even the positions of the players involved full support of the americans would involve them lending money to greece sun carriage well here is lagarde s latest statement judge for yourself lagarde does indeed want significant debt relief and greece will be offered significant debt relief by the eurozone there are a lot of pieces to put in place hence why final decisions will be made in october i think a lot of legal issues are being explored greece may even get up to 60 year extensions that s not the real point however the real issue is what is greece going to do to get itself into shape http www imf org external np sec pr 2015 pr15381 htmstatement by imf managing director christine lagarde on greecepress release no 15 381august 14 2015ms christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund imf made the following statement today the policy package specified in the memorandum of understanding mou recently agreed between the greek authorities and european institutions with input from fund staff is a very important step forward it not only reverses much of the policy backtracking that caused the previous program to run seriously off track but puts in place wide ranging policies to restore fiscal sustainability financial sector stability and a return to sustainable growth i particularly welcome the authorities efforts to overcome the serious loss of confidence in recent months through strong upfront actions most of these actions have been fully specified in the mou and key measures including in the fiscal structural areas will be implemented as prior actions for the disbursement of the first european stability mechanism esm tranche in two areas that are of critical importance for greece s ability to return to a sustainable fiscal and growth path the specification of remaining parametric fiscal measures not least a sizeable package of pension reforms needed to underpin the program s still ambitious medium term primary surplus target and additional measures to decisively improve confidence in the banking sector the government needs some more time to develop its program in more detail this is understandable and i am encouraged in this regard by the government s commitment to work with its european partners and the fund on completing these essential reforms in the coming months with the detailed specification of these outstanding reforms the recently agreed mou will entail a very decisive and credible effort on the part of the greek authorities to restore robust and sustainable economic growth however i remain firmly of the view that greece s debt has become unsustainable and that greece cannot restore debt sustainability solely through actions on its own thus it is equally critical for medium and long term debt sustainability that greece s european partners make concrete commitments in the context of the first review of the esm program to provide significant debt relief well beyond what has been considered so far in conclusion i believe that the actions to be taken by the authorities by the time of the first review in conjunction with the policies specified in the mou once they have been supplemented by the above mentioned fiscal structural and financial sector reforms as well as by significant debt relief will provide the basis for a credible and comprehensive program to restore medium term sustainability we look forward to working closely with greece and its european partners in the coming months to put in place all the elements needed for me to recommend to the fund s executive board to consider further financial support for greece wimrom this one too obama agreeing to give iran legitimacy and a path to nukes in exchange for very credible person i don t think if anyone is interested in what the greeks had been attempting to do these past few months the confession of giannis dragasakis deputy prime minister and supposed chief of economic policy is illuminating for recent developments from an interview a few days ago we thought that if we threatened to exit the eurozone then the europeans would be frightened three years ago this might have been the case but in the meantime they had taken their measures to our surprise mr sch uble proposed that if we wanted to leave the eurozone then he would help us the prime minister had said that we don t want the imf but on this issue we didn t have a single ally drakasakis added that this another point of government weakness was the ignorance of the terms of negotiation which were not done freely but through a whole system with rules and staff http www ethnos gr article asp catid 22767 subid 2 pubid 64233300 padme hum yes and it also puts into perspective sch uble s proposal for a greek time out from the eurozone it wasn t because this is what he genuinely thought is the best solution but because in these hard negotiations he was presenting them with their own idiocy so you re threatening to leave the eurozone if we don t write off all your debts thinking this is going to frighten us go on leave the eurozone then judge barbier they were bluffing to the point that they actually honestly believed that the eurozone would back down at their threats syriza anel truly believed that all they needed to do was be really really hardline and they would be able to force their position because the rest of the eurozone would be scared at the thought that greece would otherwise go crashing out of the euro and this would bring down the whole of the eurozone this in itself is an admission that their tactics were a to threaten their eu partners who had lent them hundreds of billions of euros b to risk the destruction of the eurozone which shows their immense naivety and stupidity drakasakis other point is also important that they didn t realise that negotiations in the eu were done on the basis of a set of rules and that the main work was done through staff teams this shows again their immense naivety and stupidity but also their small world view and their extreme provincialism that they were so removed from the world of real politics on an international level this kind of haggling might work in greece where government s aim is to satisfy its political clients and certain interest groups but it won t work in the real world where the results of negotiations have to be about actually solving real problems not sidestepping them padme hum this is true but lagarde has to make these sounds to keep the non western imf countries on board especially in an era of challenging western dominance over such international organisations anne i don t think so i think the oversight of the programme will be done in a much more serious way now tsipras although still muttering some of the usual blah has actually become much more serious and attuned to what needs to be done now i also think although this might seem paradoxical that he s ready to take on some of the thorniest issues that the previous governments kept shunning for example reform of the pensions system which has been delayed from 2010 and even abolishing some of the lavish tax breaks that farmers get yesterday he announced that if farmers tax benefits are to be abolished then so should greek mps he has proposed that greek mps whose salaries are untaxed now start paying tax i didn t even realise this that greek mps do not pay income tax after all these years all the arguments tensions and acrimony that europe has gone through over the greek issue after all the supposed austerity in greece after all the claims of unsustainable debt and no government bothered to raise the issue of taxing mps so i think we should say kudos to tsipras for that especially if he can tie it to the reform of tax breaks to farmers maljoffre when exactly did greece transfer heaps of money to germany and others maljoffre he isn t presenting any facts and nor are you neither you nor piketty have presented as a fact a single transfer of billions from greece to germany and others now please state an actual amount and a date of transfer from greece to germany and others maljoffre how much of these putative figures has greece actually transferred to eurozone nations since you mention 2012 2013 figures there was a point when countries like spain and italy were borrowing at very high interest rates in order to lend to greece which thanks to the bailout is borrowing at extremely low interest rates with long term maturities in other words they were paying more than greece was in order to lend to greece let s also not forget the billions greece gets each year from germany and others in eu funds funds not loans which never need to be paid back but again please tell us with facts to back up your claims exactly how much greece has transferred to germany and others genauer and dates when those figures were apparently paid maljoffre nope you have never linked to or even outlined a payment made by greece to germany and others of course i don t read your every post thoroughly so might have missed the one where you linked to a news report stating that greece had transferred funds to germany and others but i think that the truth is that you can t link to such reports because they were never written because it was never the case that greece transferred funds to germany and others i also note that you deleted the post where you claimed that greece had transferred heaps to germany and others good thing whistler quoted some of it maljoffre wrote and deleted many hundreds of billions of euros profit that germany and others have made in interest on lending the eu has become a transfer union transferring heaps of money from greece to germany and others did you perhaps delete it because you realised that you can t back up the claims you make in it and because others have picked you up on this you are now trying to erase what your inaccurate claims maljoffre oh you mean the imf are the others not the eurozone countries by the way your link is to a biased piece of nonsense that presents no facts and just repeats the same usual false drivel which you then come on here and repeat having satisfied yourself that you have a link to your claims as the first commenter there says 3 6 is ridiculously low for the risk when the market demands up to 20 so in your opinion the imf should not charge any interest whatsoever for the loans it makes so all those poor african countries that contribute funds to the imf should just borrow at higher interest rates than 3 6 so that greece can be bailed out at no interest whatsoever in other words african taxpayers have to pay for greek taxpayers not to have to pay to be bailed out but please tell us when greece transferred heaps of money billions even to germany and others in the eurozone this in the same talking germany has made a profit of 380 million euro from greek loans and austria100 million euro as i read recently not to mention the rest of the whining eu partners is not evidence that greece has transferred anything it s made up drivel i can t see your previous comment at the point where you originally posted it all i can see is this comment has been removed i note that you reposted it below and not in this thread but 41 minutes ago but please post a credible link to something like bloomberg the ft or even the greek government stating that greece has transferred billions to germany and others i doubt you will be able to however because it isn t true and even if it was the interest rate for greece s repayments to the eurozone which haven t started yet would still be at a much lower interest rate than anything greece could have got on the market maljoffre hey maljoffre why did you delete your comment and then repost it you forgot to delete the high quality global journalism bit which shows that you cut and paste your comment from before did you also edit it greece is the financial milkcow to the eu the imf and to germany oh yes they wouldn t be able to survive without money from greece i mean the heaps of billions of hundreds that greece transfers to germany make up 10 of german gdp and most people might think that greece is a recipient member state of the eu having received hundreds of billions in cash to spend as it wished since it joined but actually it s the eu s biggest creditor nation not germany as for the imf greece proudly joined sudan somalia and zimbabwe as the only countries in arrears to the imf it also got itself into the same category as zambia when it was in the middle of a 1980s war with the bundling the payments arrangement maljoffre the last paragraph you talk of which apparently says greece had paid germany 360 million euros in interest and austria 100 million in interest is not a fact it s the opinion of someone on the internet your link is to a political site that simply spins out numbers without offering any evidence for them and even if those figures were true 360 million and 100 million are not hundreds of billions as you claimed if you want to be convincing link to a credible news agency with dates and figures maljoffre i m not saying greece receives special treatment i m saying its a net recipient country not a net creditor so your claim that greece is the eu s or germany s milk cow is farcical more like the eu is greece s milk cow more to the point is what a country does with the funds it receives does it put them to good use in infrastructure or training or does it spend them on useless projects the only aim of which is to strengthen certain politicians and interest groups germany contributes 26 bn to the eu and receives 13 bn in funds a net contribution of 13 bn euros greece contributes 1 79 bn and receives 7 2 bn in funds a net receipt of almost 5 5 bn breakdown of germany s finances with the eu in 2013 total eu spending in germany 13 056 billiontotal eu spending as of german gni 0 47 total german contribution to the eu budget 26

about eu countries member countries greece index_en htm maljoffre yeah yeah yeah night maljoffre 360 millions is not the same as 360 billions do you get the difference 360 millions is nothing and 20 millions a year is nothing the only thing it shows is just how low greek interest rates are in fact if all greece has to pay its largest single creditor in interest a year is 20 million euros then greece has a very very very good deal and claims that greek debt is unsustainable are false if you think that 20 million a year makes greece germany s milkcow then you don t know what you re saying but i presume in your opinion greece should be borrowing from the markets and paying 500 billion a year in interest rates greek bonds are still over a 10 yield today maljoffre piketty has a certain very left wing perspective and also doesn t know anything about the greek situation but again he does not state when greece transferred billions to germany and others please post a link where it is actually stated that greece made such a transfer not hypothetical biased anti bailout opinions because that s all piketty is giving here please make the next link one that actually states the amount of billions that greece transferred to germany and others and also the date maljoffre another thorough and fact based response from maljoffre good night and enjoy the summer holidays maljoffre but you said hundreds of billions before and so what if greece has paid a very low level of interest to germany with only 20 million euros per year for the coming years do you think that s a lot do you think it s strangling greece like piketty is trying to claim what interest rate do you think greece should be paying one thing that s always puzzled me if greece s bailout is so onerous why does it insist on borrowing more from the troika why doesn t it just go straight to the markets why did syriza waste all this time to arrange a new 86 bn euros loan from the troika when the greek could simply go to the markets and borrow i m not sure at what interest rate that would be though maljoffre could you tell us what interest rate the market would give greece now maljoffre i m glad you acknowledge the hundreds of billions is wrong now can you please explain just what is your problem greece s interest rates to the eurozone are very low whatever germany is receiving in interest from greece is a pittance do you disagree with the bailouts then how would greece have survived these past few years or survive over the next few years do you seriously seriously think greece s interest rates are onerous but they are well below what greece would pay on the markets and it was already written into the 2012 bailout that the debt would be managed if by 2020 it was over 120 of gdp do you think all of greece s debt should just be written off but why should the taxpayers of poorer eurozone countries or any eurozone country or even poorer countries like zimbabwe or ethiopia via the imf pay for the excesses of the greek state especially when the greek state has done very little to reform itself and the resistance to reform we re seeing is mainly from the vested interests who want to maintain their privileges anne don t worry anne as usual metrognome contradicts himself first he says imf s reps are already embedded in the process i think he means that the imf reps were in greece last week in old troika style then he says the imf has already unequivocally terminated the existing programme and the 16bn will be repurposed elsewhere within the fund so according to metrognome the imf is involved but it isn t involved sounds like varoufakis the imf will be part of the new bailout which will involve significant debt relief but any debt relief will only be made after reforms have been implemented there will be more oversight of implementation of reforms and dispersal of new tranches will be dependent on reforms being implemented on time there is a lot of irony on this but that s what happens when you try to go up against reality as the greek government did and failed athens resident no fiscal transfers a debt writedown would equate to a fiscal transfer the 2012 debt writedown was to private creditors not eurozone governments this is obvious to anyone with a grasp of the basic facts the more sensible option would be greece not continuing with actions that damage its economy further and make its debts even greater such as we have seen in the past six months there is something bizarrely surreal about this article despite michel sapin somehow managing to break his arm while filling his car with petrol and francois hollande being the most unpopular french president ever i still can t imagine that the french government are really this stupid firstly before the greek pseudo referendum hollande and merkel in a joint statement said that the referendum would be considered a referendum on membership of the eurozone hence hollande publicly implied that a no result in the referendum would be interpreted as a cue for the rest of the eurozone to make preparations so as to remove greece from the eurozone secondly the german grexit proposal was backed by apparently 15 member states of the eurozone hence it is not a case of nasty germany against poor greece and everyone else in any case the whole point of the proposal was a threat to greece so that the country would stop messing about and prevaricating and start reforming and we saw last week despite the refusal since 2010 a greek government voted to stop early retirements at obscenely young ages is emanuel macron really that stupid most eurozone members i e nearly all of them who sided with germany are catholic countries but they are the poor and generally colonised catholic countries of european history they aren t the uber rich of the grand france and italy greece along with cyprus are orthodox of course generally abstemious frugal living on a religious diet of so much fasting it lowered the death rate with a historically poor population but uber rich leaders in recent decades they have become nouveau riche and have no real idea how to handle money what s even worse about this report is that it wipes out from history the extreme obnoxious and destructive behaviour of yiannis varoufakis who destroyed whatever was left of his country s economy it also wipes out the stupidity of syriza and their anel partners p s let s not forget a substantial amount of germany is catholic including the last pope and most of bavaria where the anti bailout csu is from metrognome so metro you think greece should leave the eurozone you agree with sch uble then p s france and italy absolutely back the deal reached last week and believe greece should reform why matteo renzi even announced the floating of 40 of the italian state post office today if only alexis tsipras would do the same the real greybeard except that backfired when the official creditors and ratings agencies publicly stated that not paying the imf wouldn t be considered a default they knew very well that not paying was a tactic tomod_globalbarrel com we re still waiting for the us to make its generous contribution of several tens of billions of dollars to the greek bailout imf says debt relief after reforms greece already had the biggest debt write off in history of 100 billion euros and the possibility of further debt relief was written into the bailout agreement the new thing now is that 5 months of a syriza government have destroyed the greek economy and made the greek debt unsustainable it was sustainable until syriza got into power that s what the imf report says not only that but in the past two weeks syriza anel have increased greece s need for extra funding to 90 billion euros greek banks which tsipras destroyed in one fell swoop with his referendum announcement will need at least 50 billion euros just to survive the economists who have actually studied greece s economy and not those who make general grand statements without having researched the subject would tell you that up until a few weeks ago greece s debt was sustainable and that what is more urgent are serious structural reforms in order to create an economy that can grow tom from finland you are this guy https en wikipedia org wiki tom_of_finlandthis is not true and the debt relief argument is just an attempt by commentators to pretend to take a balanced view debt relief was already written into the bailout programme all that was required was for greece to make serious reforms the few reforms it has made it did so dragging and screaming and some of the most important issues the collapsing pension system in particular have not been touched an intelligent tsipras on becoming prime minster would have pushed for even lower interest rates and longer debt maturities this would have been accepted by the troika if he made a serious attempt at tax collection and tackling corruption as were his flagship policies his government has done nothing about those issues either now all he has achieved in the past ten days is to destroy his banking system encourage greeks not to pay anything they owe the state miss the imf payments not pay pensioners their full pensions as well as lose the last 7 billion euro tranche of the now ended bailout all this damage will all add up to a bill approaching 100 billion euros on the contrary this mad behaviour will only have confirmed for the eurozone countries that a debt write off would have been throwing their taxpayers money down the drain in any case even tsipras has realised that greece cannot walk away from its debts martin sandbu looking at things in his rational northern european but not eurozone way is unable to identify the real reason tsipras is desperate he sees that his strategy is not working he sees the banks collapsing that people can t get their money that pensions aren t being paid that the yes vote may win that the greek people are turning against him that although the greek economy has ground to a halt this is having a very limited impact on the eurozone and the global economy and is trying to remedy the situation but being a hardline fool of limited intelligence he is unable to offer a sincere proposal just more cunning trying to make it seem as though he is being reasonable but the creditors are the ones rejecting an agreement sandbu is also wedded to the idea that the creditors made mistakes and that is the root of the greek problem debt relief was always on the table and formally since 2012 the greek government would have to make certain reforms first and no greek government has wanted to this isn t a french german opposition thing the problem is greek refusal to reform the mindset that got greece into this situation is very hard to change greek voters have come to resent the eu s interference in their domestic politics what interference exactly aside from keeping greece alive and what is the evidence that greek voters have come to resent alleged eu interference aside from syriza anel golden dawn supporters who are anti eu anyway except when it comes to eu money with banks closed and capital controls in place the mood in greece is very finely balanced regarding who is to blame for this alarming situation since this alarming situation arose immediately after mr tsipras made his referendum announcement when greeks themselves started rushing to the atms i think it s quite clear who is to blame for it editorialmuse alexis tsipras panos kammenos zoe konstantopoulou yiannis varoufakis panagiotis lafazanis nikos pappas nikos voutsis prokopis pavlopoulos yiannis dragasakis euclid tsakalotos adedy genop deh etc etc stupid as they were i think you d find it hard to find any actual legal grounds against george papandreou laliotis simitis venizelos etc papantoniou maybe strange that you slam a papandreou and seem to defend those who have tried to resurrect him and bring him back from the grave alexis tsipras and syriza who are literally trying to resurrect his policies labour laws university counter reforms ooh you forgot kostakis karamanlis deng deng is 100 right nikolaus excellent comment this a pre euro eu with 28 currencies would have seen the most appalling crisis in many member states except perhaps the strongest a fact that many ignore forget don t even contemplate blc111 taxes are syriza s proposals reforms are merkel s syriza doesn t want reform of greece its clients would get too upset and it would require too much thinking luca gaballo risk sharing would mean all following the same rules greece doesn t want to follow the rules shocked and amazed erm the banks lent to the greek government to spend within greece the original money lent was spent on greeks if the troika hadn t lent to greece in order to repay its debts then greece would have gone bankrupt a long time ago greece s creditors are more than capable of standing on their own feet greece isn t any violent demonstrations in athens in the event of a grexit would not be by supporters of syriza or anel but outraged greek citizens out to bring down the government p s is it possible not to use so many links in what way is the eurozone actually flawed one reads this in sandbu s column at any rate but it s never really stated what the supposed problems are all sandbu seems to do is defend the syriza position without recognising that greece is a special case and the country would have destroyed itself on its own anyway if it were outside of the eurozone he does acknowledge that fiscal transfers are not an answer as for a more developed capital market that s an eu wide problem not specifically a eurozone one it s being worked on by someone from the most anti euro country in europe lord commissioner hill if we re going to find the solutions we need to name the problems first stonebird hm so according to you there is no independent country of ukraine it s really a province of russia btw i think the first rus were swedes monty 100 years wow what a really long and historical presence not what about the crimean tatars who d been there for several centuries before the russians they totally oppose russia s annexation of their homeland but let s not forget the reason crimea was given to ukraine because crimea has no land border with russia whereas it s attached to ukraine russia also needs to stop thinking it can boss europe around and start treating us like partners and not like lackeys if it wants to build gas pipelines through europe then it has to follow eu rules and no one in what you ignorantly call old europe supports putin s little military violations against the nordics or new europe iglinavos good blog ad fonz and what exactly are greek exports i think it s more a case of neither ukraine or georgia are anywhere near ready for eu membership and won t be for 30 years at least ealing in my experience of talking to ukrainians it does mean going on holiday to the eu schengen zone because getting a visa to do that is currently extremely difficult and rather stressful sparkspread different accounting methods the uk includes prostitution and the black market in its gdp calculations france doesn t if france did it would beat the uk the difference between the two is currently statistically negligible anyway in any case what the article really means is the two largest relevant member states the uk doesn t fit into the category of relevant a case in point merkel and hollande pledge to strive for an end to fossil fuel pollution cameron is nowhere to be seen peter_fsb samaras didn t push for early elections syriza did by rejecting the presidential candidate stavros dimas new democracy proposed this triggered general elections and in the end syriza put in place an appalling presidential candidate provopis pavlopoulos who is a symbol of much of the corruption and cronyism of the greek state rocky and we ll see the real differences in political stature between the two when may goes to brussels and tries to trick the eu27 into giving england access to the single market without accepting freedom of movement klirhed yes but president clinton and chancellor merkel will be leaders of major world powers the us and germany europe respectively may will be prime minister of a diminished country with increasingly marginal influence and especially in the next few years a very uncertain future the three are hardly on the same level archimides would the british government have a canadian run a major government ministry and set policy that s a more appropriate comparison in any case it seems that it s the british government that has a problem with whoever the commission president might be the commission president works very closely with the eurozone on a political and economic level even to the point of approving of and monitoring eurozone countries budgets and fiscal and economic policy the commission president thus has to be politically committed to the euro distant observer were it not for the fact that all of cameron s masters in washington bonn brussels bonn and cameron thinks juncker s a face of the 80s more like england s own ukipers are the national party leaders were bamboozled into supporting this scheme which was initially designed by the european parliamentary socialist party as a way of foisting martin schulz upon us this is clear from the term spitzenkandidaten there is nothing democratic about a new scheme that has no basis in the treaties and which was never discussed or agreed upon through proper eu channels but instead suddenly emerged as a secret backroom deal in fact not only does this new scheme have no basis in the treaties it is trying to invert them whereas the lisbon treaty stipulates that the european council nominates the commission president and the parliament approves here we have the parliament claiming for itself the right to nominate and demanding that the council approve whatever it s presented with the people who were never consulted by the decision makers of the european parliament as to whether this scheme should be adopted as a way of selecting the commission president were the citizens of europe ourselves continually expanding the powers of the european parliament especially by stealth fait accompli as in the manner here does not engage the people of europe to any greater degree all it will ultimately do is alienate us even further from the european parliament which many european citizens already have their doubts about i seriously doubt that most of europe s citizens are happy with the recalibration of the balance of power between the eu institutions that is being attempted here especially since the institution that they feel most expresses them the european council comprised of their elected leaders and the individuals who actually have to implement eu legislation is being sidelined and marginalised in this way moreover and most importantly of all this spitzenkandidaten scheme does nothing to ensure that good candidates would be selected in fact it does the opposite juncker was just about the only one that is passably suited to the job the other party candidates were a joke and on the very unlikely chance that the greens won how exactly would two people do the commission president s job and where is this foreseen in any of the treaties now we are in danger of having a system foisted upon us that will only permit for consideration as commission president over ambitious meps or recently unemployed prime ministers or other officials whose term somewhere else has just ended this spitzenkandidaten scheme greatly limits the search for potential commission presidents and also politicises the role of the commission president in a partisan way schulz in particular was trying to campaign on a blatantly party agenda and a very ideological one at that the role of the commission president is to ensure that the eu treaties are being adhered to and that national governments are doing what they agreed to do not to push a party manifesto if you want to get the people of europe more engaged in the activities of the european parliament then ensure that good people are elected to the ep most today are non entities who ve just worked their way up the party ladder who will also be able to communicate effectively with the citizens of europe on the activities of the european parliament in the strictly defined areas of its competence very few are able to do this e scrooge seriously learn a few basic facts which might have been obvious even to you if you had actually read the above article eu representatives by which i presume you mean meps are directly elected by the voters of europe it s interesting how all the photos of the pro russian demonstrators in eastern ukraine show a bunch of slim fit and trained looking young men almost all with balaclavas or a face covering of some kind with what appears to be very short hair all moving in a very coordinated manner with each other as though they are some kind of specially trained military corps no older or younger people students hippies women kids fat people people who look like most of the people on an ordinary high street as they would be if this were a popular uprising musso there are many other parts of the eu aside from italy why do you think your view is the only right one go and look at most of the eu they don t share your views they want fiscal responsibility the days when you expect somebody is going to carry you are over the hegemon merkel isn t imposing anything policies she supports pass because that is what the majority of the eu also wants if you believe in the community method then listen to the other members of the community you might hear something different from what you hear in italy and if italy wants to be listened to and taken seriously it had better eventually start sorting its huge mess out mr gilady slightly rewrites what tyler br l actually said he didn t say that the lake placid games were the most memorable for him he would have been 11 at the time but that their logo captured the olympic spirit he also believes that the innsbruck 1977 games worked well and lillehammer had a good flag waving spirit the beijing olympic winter games will also make considerable use of venues built for the 2008 games to host many of the ice events this is a good use of resources but it kind of underlines the point that olympic games are taking place in the same city indeed in the exact same venues as only 14 years before it s also a funny mixing up of the summer and winter olympics and denies the winter olympics their own identity far from being anti asia or a flag waver only for the west br l s choice from among the candidate cities for the 2022 winter olympics was almaty mr gilady has not been able to explain in this letter why china was again chosen and not a country that has not before hosted the games brexit means brexit you forgot pound going down down down the rest of the stuff will start going down or more down after the obvious lag that is needed for the repercussions to start having an impact prices will go up however and this is before article 50 is triggered and the uk actually leaves the uk never paid a share of the greek bailout funny how brexiteers are a little confused about such things brexit means brexit what roth means by special status is not quite what you think it does as he points out it s a different situation when a country s been a member for 43 years as opposed to a country that has never been a member as he also points out there will be no access to the single market without freedom of movement of course there will be a trade arrangement between britain and the eu which the eu will make sure is of benefit to the eu close collaboration on a wide range of areas that have been developed over the 43 years of membership will be retained as far as possible despite brexiteer opposition there will be long transitional periods and interim situations that s the special status so despite brexiteers desire to destroy all the close relationships with the eu that have developed over the past 43 years that won t happen completely i made a conscious decision to be very low in sterling assets going into the june 23 referendum vote of course you did john because even you know that exiting the eu is damaging for sterling assets and for anyone who not only trades in sterling but has to live with it as their currency jo johnson science minister two brothers in government is this a first kdr kdr is one of those brexiters who want everything in britain s relationship with the eu to stay the same once the country s left the only difference being that we have a far more bureaucratic system of attracting migrant workers to do necessary jobs and britain won t pay any contributions yet will still somehow manage to participate in things like the european space agency brexiteers don t even understand what it means for britain to be outside of the eu golightly how can brexit british exit from the eu be going ok when brexit hasn t actually happened yet all that s happened is the vote just wait until the country does actually leave the eu for the real results which won t all be apparent in only a few weeks there will certainly be immediate negative results but the real repercussions will be felt for years and decades after in any case unless you find the idea of being 10 poorer considering the plunge in the pound ok and that will start feeding into higher prices on imports which is everything even almost everything made in the uk because of imported parts then things aren t going ok aside from that considering hammond hasn t been able to identify where lost eu funds for farming and research will come from after 2020 things certainly don t seem to be ok it s a shame that you consider the ability to use big wordies i e having an education a bad thing sun carriage that s what the hard core brexiteers will be calling you soon with your arguments in favour of britain remaining in the single market but yeah let s just overlook the fact that brexit is a disaster for british science and research and eventually the producers will have to increase prices because of the fall in profits from the plunging pound mjdubuque you re so right not let s leave things in italy as they are it s a model economy christopher c well a plunging pound isn t a good thing for a start it means it s much more expensive for brits to go abroad this is an immediate drop in the quality of life then let s be honest much of the british leisure and catering industry exists because of eu nationals when britain is out and freedom of movement ends it s going to be so much harder to find the staff not only will that push wages up leading to price increases for customers but we re currently in the period of a lag between the plunge in the pound and the rise in prices as companies have to readjust to make up their lost profits that will also push prices for tourists up plus the uk is still expensive even with a 10 decline in the currency also as you point out the terrorist attacks in france have had an impact on visitor numbers whereas tourists to other european countries are up so the increase in tourism figures is a europe wide phenomenon not specific to just the uk france s problems will pass kdr why would manufacturers want to locate in britain when it s soon going to be cut off from supply chains and markets chamberlain it s amazing how brexiters are unable to comprehend that the drop in the pound is actually really really bad for the average brit great foreigners snapping up more property thus a increasing migration b making it harder for british people to buy a house ealing have you been getting good rates for your pounds ever since you voted to leave the eu sun carriage but it can refashion the landscape to make the uk an attractive location for both home and overseas investors to locate their production here sure it can remain part of the eu if it wants to make the uk somewhere that is a waste of time for investors to locate their production in then it can simply leave the eu good suggestion move the capital of the country to somewhere in the midlands that will bring industry back the other stupid use of referendums is when there is no point to them at all but they are just a political manoeuvre i e no specific political issue has arisen or national choice needs to be taken but a politician needs to get out of a party political fix i can see a vague point in referendums on issues like adopting a completely new constitution or whether a country should join the eu although even then politicians shouldn t call them unless they expect to win but a referendum on a huge issue simply to stop one s internal political party conflicts such as cameron s on the eu or on an issue that doesn t even exist simply to shut up critics in one s party after which you ignore the result such as alexis tsipras on a deal that wasn t even on the table with the eurozone are an abuse of democracy the fact that the campaigns for both the above referendums had weird durations cameron s referendum being called 3 years in advance and tsipras 10 days in advance shows that their purpose was something other than what the question was ostensibly about the premise of this article by sebastian the spectator payne is that britain exiting the eu is the right thing to do and that labour mps should just accept this but what if you re a labour mp who sincerely and rightly believes that britain leaving the eu is a calamitous mistake of historic proportions are you simply meant to get on message and help to implement national suicide lapsed pacifist i have a suspicion that after a couple of years certainly when labour loses the next general election in 2020 if not earlier many of these lefty activists will have got bored with labour and with jeremy corbyn and will move on to the next social movement leaving the real labour people to pick up the pieces i also suspect that at some point the union bosses will also start to get disillusioned with corbyn real labour could be the name for the breakaway party of labour mps sure the british voting to leave the eu is just like commodity prices or a general election it is much too early to assess the full impact of the brexit vote and volatility may continue for some time another person who seems to think the process of britain leaving the eu is limited only to the vote no there s the actual leaving and then the being out that will follow long term processes that can only devalue the investments of british pension schemes even further footsteps this is the second ft profile of timothy in a week nothing on hill yet tony islington a bit like jeremy corbyn juncker doesn t particularly want the commission to be leading the negotiations nor does he want overall responsibility for them the commission will be crucial however in providing legal and technocratic expertise more to the point once the general outlines of a uk exit deal are drawn up it will be the commission that does most of the work of actually constructing the deal once the uk has actually exited the eu and then needs to negotiate a trade deal with europe then that will be the job of the commission as all trade deals are with european council and parliament input of course the tweets are really annoying especially since the comments keep disappearing and all we get are more stupid tweets the pouca this court of justice decision means nothing to banks outside the eu us and swiss banks were not under it able to set up to do euro clearing from new york z rich or singapore moreover the logic of the decision depends on one key detail the uk being a member of the eu without it the ecb would have the competence because the rights at issue would not be guaranteed by the tfeu this is the bit bobby r is finding it hard to grasp bobby r i suppose we should take word of randomcomemmenter sic over ceo of lse can you you see the irony the ceo of lse said there was no immediate threat do you see the middle word immediate do you understand that there is such a thing as 1 3 5 years time bobby r so it will lose it and then get it back bobby r i was discussing this issue with you well before pouca came on i m far less optimistic that the british economy will fare well if britain leaves the eu nothing can replace being part of the world s largest trade block that is on your doorstep being part of the eu s single market and having the passporting rights for the eu which are what make the city so attractive to international finance not to mention the political cultural and social advantages of the eu there aren t any ftas with other countries on other continents that can replace all that and all to get back control i e be weaker and hence able to do less hence having less control in reality bobby r wow you must have a crystal ball or something it s nothing to do with crystal balls but logical consequences bobby r ttip may or may not be dead but britain is back of the queue in any trade negotiations with the us to be honest i don t really get your last sentence also i don t think what i m saying is simply speculation bobby r as you say sweden poland etc are in the eu britain will at some point soon not be so please explain to us how eu treaties or even ecj rulings will help third countries outside the eu to whom such treaties are not applicable bobby r firstly there is an issue over whether treaty change is needed more to the point even if it is so what there will be a treaty change at some point even if it s several years away and outside the eu the uk will not be able to influence a new treaty even if the euro clearing rules stay the same the city of london s position in general is undermined it only requires a little less euro denominated clearing to go on in london a few hundred jobs to shift from london to paris dublin frankfurt or somewhere else a little bit more investment to be directed to somewhere in the eu and the shining city and the country as a whole will start to lose its gloss just look at all the downbeat financial numbers we re getting now when all that s happened thus far is that the vote was held a few weeks ago to see how the position of being great can easily and quickly shift to being ok of course the ceo of the lse is trying to sound as reassuring as possible but note he did say there is no immediate threat not there is no risk of any threat at all at any time christopher c brexit has not actually happened yet so it s not possible at present to talk about what has been happening after brexit no one has claimed wwiii a depression or asteroids will happen just that britain will be seriously damaged and diminished and this will became increasingly apparent over the years of course the eu isn t going anywhere why should it it s here to stay with or without the uk will you be staying in the uk however sun carriage oh so the ippr whose views you report on approvingly argues that britain should basically stay in the eu with some cosmetic changes such as a pseudo brake on freedom of movement unlikely to be used considering all these eastern europeans are actually useful didn t they also consider that in the process britain would be giving up its voice place rights votes and vetoes in the eu it would have to leave all eu institutions not be part of the european council have no meps no commissioner not be part of any decision making have no role in shaping eu laws no participation in eu relations with the rest of the world lose the global cachet of being in the eu and hence be seen as of less importance and of as having less clout by the rest of the world so what exactly are the benefits of leaving the average supermarket sources about two thirds of its products from britain thanks to farm workers from the eu the spectacle of well off eurocrats fighting hard to maintain their own pensions while demanding cuts in pensions in countries such as greece is unlikely to play well actually the spectacle of britain trying to wriggle out of paying the pension liabilities of retired british officials and instead expecting greece ireland romania or even france and germany to pay for those british nationals is what is unlikely to play well but gideon in his usual snobby anti eu manner can t see the real issue britain only ever demanding and whining even as it withdraws but instead has to find some tenuous angle to perpetuate the pathetic popular prejudices about the eu that have landed us in the situation of leaving the eu adam smith it s not democratic in a multilingual environment to expect officials to have a basic knowledge of more than one language another angle jonathan hill could really have made a difference for the uk eu in financial services if the uk hadn t narrowly voted to leave the eu rosebud well if you actually read the article linked at the words now suggest you will learn that while many surveys reported falling confidence before the vote on june 23 the official figures show growth of 0 6 per cent in the second quarter of the year compared with 0 4 per cent in the first a little stronger than the 0 5 per cent expected by economists and the monthly breakdown showed that the good headline figure was driven by very strong growth in april with much flatter performances in may and june so while growth in april may have been better than expected in may and june it started to flatten i wonder if that had anything to do with the referendum i would actually say that the comment about the april figures in this article of 1 august is a little odd considering most of the rest of the time the figures are as expected it seems more like ft s little odd editorial line of always throwing a on the other quip in i guess to make the article seem balanced a fund manager i ve noticed that the daily hate mail occasionally allows a different dominant line in their comments presumably for some fake perspective or it depends which moderator is doing the shift most of the time it s packed with whackoes ohneeigenschaften debilitating red tape of the brussels science funding bureaucracy evaluation procedures by one s peers to assess whether a project is worth funding or not complaints about procedures are usually made by unsuccessful candidates at least the poster acknowledges that brexit will only create more red tape for the uk stephen t one of the hidden assets of attracting research students from around the world is the human networks this creates that often blossoms later into friends in the right places this involves migration visas work permits points systems applications bureaucracy plus researchers want their families to be able to visit live with them one of the great things about britain being in the eu and the freedom of migration is that the best european researchers can come to britain just like that ojathome my first thought was why was the eu allocating research funding in the first place surely this is precisely the sort of decision that should be taken by member states the eu doesn t allocate research funding researchers apply for eu funding presenting project proposals that are evaluated by their fellow academics the allocation is researcher driven not eu government driven middle east insider why do brexiters trash the so called luvvies i e people in the arts culture and academia all the time even when in the same breath they are actually acknowledging just how much the luvvies contribute to british economy dean armond there will be some tourism boost but not a huge amount london for example is still expensive to visit and as a result of brexit the price of flights will rise once completely outside the eu without a freedom of movement arrangement queues at passport control and customs that s what you have to go through when outside a customs union will be much longer also without the eu nationals who work in a lot of the british arts vacation leisure etc sectors it will be harder and more expensive to find the staff for the tourism industry other consumer items that britain cannot make will also become more expensive as companies raise prices e g computers and cars and pretty much everything made outside of the uk even stuff made in the uk often needs imported parts and imported raw materials much of which are priced in dollars hence prices will rise markedly farmers are extremely worried about the loss of their eu subsidies and the loss of the eu market if british farming doesn t maintain the same standards as the eu as a result of brexit many british farms will become unsustainable and the loss of eu farmhands will be a particular blow but it s ok we ll be able to use all those harmful pesticides that the nasty brussels diktats have banned which is just as good because the produce will be lying around uneaten much longer so it had better be longer lasting but sure we can still have lots of cox s apples and king edward spuds rotting on the ground because there aren t enough eastern europeans to pick them who needs all that poncy foreign fruit and veg just like who needs to go on holiday abroad some might see it as a decline in their living standards but a cabbage based diet is good for you dean armond brexit coincides with a fall in the value of the pound oh no the brexit vote didn t coincide with a fall in the value of the pound the brexit vote caused the fall in the value of the pound why don t you stop to ask just why the british pound has fallen so much it s not a result of more qe it s not because the dollar or euro have risen it s because the result of the referendum was to leave the eu and so currency traders are dumping sterling that s not actually a good thing it s like the daily express and the telegraph trumpeting the apparent fact that since the referendum britons are choosing to vacation at home rather than go abroad and this is great for the british economy when the reason they are abandoning plans to go abroad is because the pound has slid and it is now too expensive for brits to travel this is a clear sign of a decline in living standards and purchasing power reader for those apparently more important and growing markets the eu is of far far greater importance than britain is they will prioritise their relationship with the eu and not do any deal with britain that undermines it custodia legis and as the us government has made it perfectly clear a trade deal for a britain outside the eu will be a long long long time in coming by the way the reason ttip is taking such a long time like the tpp before it is because the eu wants to get the best deal and if you hadn t noticed it there s a great deal of opposition in the us among their version of brexiters to trade deals why does this article talk about post brexit britain and pre brexit levels brexit the exiting of the uk from the european union has not happened yet all that s happened is the referendum which decided that britain should exit the eu let s see how well stocks do once if that actually happens oops i don t think anyone s suggesting there should be an election now but next year spring or summer her comments suggest that britain can still secure positive results in brussels for an important industry even after its brexit vote while britain is still in the eu rosalba about as informed as any finance minister before their appointment besides she has a whole department of extremely well trained officials to help her what is it you disagree with in any case i m not sure what is so offensive about statements such as to clarify the rules to make them more proportionate and less burdensome for smaller and less complex credit institutions and investment firms or eu remuneration rules have been efficient in helping curb excessive risk taking by staff which is important for financial stability the curb on bonuses was proposed and voted on by the elected european parliament lowgrader no one said the world was ending but once britain does actually exit even you might see the wisdom of having remained in the eu the thing you hadn t noticed is that this victory is only possible because britain is still currently in the eu if britain within the eu puts forward reasonable proposals for dealing with issues then those will be listened to remaining outside the euro and hence on the fringes of europe is part of what has led britain to leave the eu let s look back 10 years after britain has exited and see if that was really a good idea by the way there have been plenty of mass murderers in recent british history from ira attacks to 7 7 to fred and rosie west but if you hand t noticed the middle east north africa is in turmoil and that s having a blowback on europe besides i thought even most brits agreed with curbs on banker bonuses matthew goodwin professor of politics at the university of kent said i m very pessimistic about the party these candidates are not prominent politicians it is going to take the party a significant amount of time just to keep itself in the limelight prof goodwin sounds like an objective scholar not free speaker that old fantasy again england will not have access to free movement of goods services and capital and it s not just about principle it s because the other 3 can t work without the 4th britain isn t going to get any deal from western european countries and poland it s only deal will come from the eu27 acting as a whole not as separate entities britain has been in the eu for 43 years if it hasn t managed to unlock trade deals between the eu and commonwealth countries in all those decades it s been a member it s hardly going to manage it when it s outside the eu brexit is the realisation of a two speed europe a more flexible eu with those who want to pool their sovereignty further and those who want greater self determination no brexit is about britain exiting the eu outside the eu britain won t be able to argue for a more flexible eu because no one will care about a third country s opinions on the eu s future rather than encouraging other member states to ask for more flexibility the disastrous consequences for britain of leaving will make the others want to work closer together similarly britain leaving has no impact on the euro despite your misunderstanding of what the eurozone is it will however result in huge damage for sterling leveller this is a great answer lots of analysis facts nuance with a deep understanding of the issues and the background placing the issue in its proper context and providing a serious examination of all the potential repercussions sun carriage except each time that the english parliament wastes its time to vote against eu directives on screw sizes or pesticides the commission acting on behalf of the whole eu will simply ban all english products that don t adhere to eu directives moreover england will be ejected from the single market if the directives aren t accepted then it s impossible for england to be in the single market because the single market cannot function without common standards if england wants to pre negotiate eu directives then it should consider becoming a member of the eu how bizarre that the eu would seek approval of its rules from non members or allow anyone outside the eu to veto the decisions it makes for its own single market the mythical taking back control that some voters thought they were voting for was shown to be based on the usual leaver lies when the british government s balance of competences study showed that the british parliament was strengthened and reinforced by eu membership as opposed to the bs about brussels tyranny but sun carriage continues to triviliase just how important a thing the eu is by putting global agreements whatever they are above the eu which offers the best trade agreement available to england in the world fatherelmer sleepwalking to oblivion actually makes a good point feca just goes to show that brexiters want to go back to some fantasy world which they imagine existed 50 years ago p s i wouldn t expect anything new in the public statements to be made after this meeting merkel will reiterate that britain can t cherry pick that the country must trigger article 50 before negotiations can begin but britain is still in the eu and the aim is to have good relations once it exits so there are all sorts of other important things to discuss e g terrorism migration may will say brexit means brexit we need a bit of time before article 50 is triggered but we can still be friends the german chancellor will have to address three questions this evening first mrs may needs to know whether the uk will be allowed to negotiate informally with the eu before triggering article 50 the formal pathway to exit many eu states insist the article 50 button should be pressed immediately before any discussions begin how far will ms merkel push back on this why would merkel wish to push back on the position that discussions can only begin once article 50 is triggered she absolutely agrees with that similarly merkel is not going to ratify britain trying to arrange trade deals before it exits the eu nor is she going to do a deal on eu british nationals by the autumn the deal on eu nationals is not hers to do and in any case is wrapped up in whatever form britain s actual exit takes e g will england be in the eea will there be long transitional periods britain may think it can try to negotiate trade deals with third countries before it leaves the eu but again without knowing the final shape of britain s exit this would be impossible to do in any case why would third countries be willing to annoy the eu on the contrary if you read what sarkozy said it only underlines just how fixed the principle of freedom of movement is for the eu even for sarkozy what sarkozy suggested would be in his new treaty were things like schengen the eurozone the commission turkey absolutely nothing on changing the principle of freedom of movement he just wants to give the vision of being a man of action and push his own vision of how the eu should be including his long standing proposal of creating a new eurozone union with its own parliament and leader and is using brexit as an excuse for this olaf von rein i thought he was last spotted on a campaign platform alongside donald trump has theresa may explained yet how she s going to have access to the single market without freedom of movement londonjp you actually think the political leaders are going to be negotiating this face to face and it won t be merkel vs may it ll be the eu27 vs may there isn t anything to negotiate britain is out if it wants access to the single market it will have to accept freedom of movement there s no sort of in between deal that may can get out of merkel or the eu27 the hard work will be for the technocrats to tease england out of eu structures and laws gresham i wasn t aware that colonies had already been established on mars plume did you get an email sent to all the active outers to fill the thread with this kind of post outlining which points you should make bobby r hilarious if you didn t notice it s scotland calling brussels not brussels calling scotland and it s scotland that wants brussels interference you deliberately ignored this bit donald tusk president of the european commission was reported to have declined a meeting with ms sturgeon tusk as the head of the european council meets only with national leaders sturgeon however is the leader of a party represented in the european parliament so it is only right that the president of the parliament meets her if he refused wouldn t that be an example of distant brussels and schulz is right regional representatives meet him and other meps all the time in other countries it is considered of great benefit if regional leaders meet meps and the ep president would you want him to reject a meeting with her wouldn t that be an example of distant brussels macmillan the core point which is continuously overlooked foreverfreedom because as long as britain s status is undetermined there will be uncertainty which will be bad for investment and jobs in britain and bad for the pound besides i thought leavers wanted to get out of the eu is the new line to try and stay in it for as long as possible falmer what a daft comment the eu is not merkel s to decide to give bits and pieces of to cameron the eu has rules that all member states must adhere to and one of those is freedom of movement the whole eu agrees with that only britain didn t the superficiality with which this argument is thrown around is but one more manifestation of english arrogance the legacy of past glories paul munton s potimarron agreed one of the funniest things over the weekend was the six screaming foreign minister boys rushing to show just how macho they are merkel a girl suggested we all stop to think for a moment nzforest i was just in the middle of responding to that i guess even he realised his comment had nothing to do with reality pjurjen the lisbon treaty was never voted down by the people of france and the netherlands there is also nowhere on earth that is constitutionally like the united kingdom i thought i d posted this before but obviously not this is an idea that the french keep pushing but they really must abandon mr sarkozy also pledged to push for a two tier europe with a eurozone that would integrate further with a common budget a wider union and a smaller remit his stance does not diverge much from that of mr jupp or socialist president fran ois hollande homarus am what is the question even what are they supposed to be having a referendum on christopher c but surely you want the fire to spread throughout europe wouldn t you be happy for hollande to risk the eu you were all for brexit and usually love marine christopher c why pro brexit because of uk debt usually you love marine and hate everything eu or is that the other christopher c robvancouver moreover aside from the platitudes about the poor voters who felt they didn t have a voice expressing their anger to the political elites there are many many people in britain who were confused about the issue weren t sure exactly what they were voting for and were really torn more to the point they had never before opposed the eu and it s only when presented with this choice that they thought that maybe there was some credible reason to consider withdrawing after all this vote was legitimising such ideas wasn t it those people will tell you that putting such responsibility on the voters for issues with such huge repercussions that they could not properly comprehend at the time especially given that leave arguments have to be presented as equal to remain arguments is utterly ridiculous hans gjertsen that s the thing and the aspect that the uk could never understand for the six original members and others that joined later the eu is something that is crucial and needs to be built and they are willing to lift the weight to build it for the rest of us the uk has only ever seen the eu as about trade having influence a place at the table british membership of the eu has only been seen as the benefit it can bring to britain not the benefits that it can bring to the eu as a whole for example it s the uk that pushed the most for the admission of the former eastern european countries partly for their stability but not for a vision of a unified europe but primarily because they thought this would water down the european project by making it wider it would make it less deep but they were never interested in the hard work of really helping these countries to democratise or to integrate the real greybeard i think he was actually the mayor of london jcjc wow the sheer ignorance and arrogance of davis in that article he is going to fall so flat on his face he knows nothing for example britain won t be able to conduct trade negotiations with non eu countries until it s out of the eu and they will take years it s not irrational for the eu not to allow free access to the single market to third countries that don t fulfil the criteria that every county has to follow including freedom of movement the scots the northern irish the universities the city are only going to tell him that what he proposes is a disaster for them the british economy will go into fretful what an idiot at least the brexit garbage and lies will be exposed for the trash they are if he tries to push for any of that and with the other twit liam fox trying to drum up international trade for a country trying to leave the eu and hence few will be interested in plus the international laughing stock boris johnson as fs the brexit bubbles will be well and truly burst what a boring bunch of grey middle aged men including the blondie great way to knife johnson keep him close but also out of the way and set him up as the fall guy when brexit goes wrong in the meantime the country will be made an international laughing stock an arch federalist who embodies what so many people in the uk thought was wrong with the eu juncker is not a federalist let alone an arch federalist he s just an easy straw man for eu haters expect lots more juncker bashing in the coming months as england doesn t get anything it wants brexiters will blame juncker for the all their failures rather than the governments of the eu27 gianttristan why would this be replacing britain s military might there isn t an eu army that britain is suddenly withdrawing from and britain is still in nato this is more about advancing the eu27 s military might france is still there too ursula von der leyen s appeal is the latest call from eu politicians to move on from the uk s planned departure and to find ways to strengthen the bloc and rally public support alternatively it s the eu27 now able to get on with things that the majority has always wanted but which were blocked by britain plus a little dig at london not to assume that it has much in the way of leverage over the eu ric i have this funny feeling that if you d been born 70 years earlier you might have been an admirer of adolf s anyway the nazi line is always silly and says more about the person saying it the international development secretary campaigned for britain to remain in the eu but tweeted that sometimes you re better off out this wasn t in reference to brexit but to coming out regarding her same sex relationship do we really have to have david davies back his potential return sounds like guesswork since he doesn t have much to offer almost all the above are awful gt or significant european funding what are the protocols for a non binding referendum shouldn t parliament have a vote since parliament is sovereign how about a general election can t wait to see may s government one presumes leadsom got herself a promotion who will be the next chancellor bobby r you mean the tory party got the message from the eu and leadsom dropped out it was the tory party that was responsible for the nine interminable weeks of a tory leadership prime minister election that we were to endure now all may needs to do is trigger article 50 as soon as possible highbury sunshine visa free travel will be rolled out across africa over a number of years it s not easy to create such a system especially in a fragmented continent it just goes to show what difficult conditions the eu has had to overcome to create a single european area of 27 riskmanager no he s just asking that they outline what new relationship they propose between the uk and the eu and to indicate how they aim to achieve that unless as a brexiter you are admitting that the leave campaign had no clue what to do next and gave no thought to what life will be like after brexit dr law has completely misunderstood the concept of flexibility within an eu context it is not about being flexible on core eu principles but on things like deadlines and targets in any case i doubt the majority of germans are in favour of greece for example continuing to act flexibly towards its debt reduction targets or implementation of reforms being flexible over core eu principles would make the eu unworkable should the eu be flexible over issues such as the independence of the judiciary and the media for example being flexible on the freedom of movement not only means that the single market cannot work in practice but it establishes discrimination between eu citizens how does dr law envisage this flexible brake would work sorry we wouldn t mind a couple more german engineers but we have too many poles so we re not going to accept any more or it s great that this slovak company wants to invest in the uk but we don t want any of their people coming over to run it in any case freedom of movement was not the reason england voted to leave the eu anti eu prejudice has been rife in england for decades migration of eu nationals is the latest red herring dr law is wrong when he claims that the referendum clearly brought out that people are not anti immigrant as the rise in racist attacks has shown he s also wrong to claim that this sentiment is shared across the continent because there is no support anywhere in the eu for curbs on the principle of freedom of movement dave merkel didn t make any surprising sweeping unilateral declaration hollande and the rest of the eu leaders knew all about it and most agreed the few who didn t had no suggestion to offer as to how to deal with the problem of huge waves of syrian refugees apart from to stick their head in the sand and expect greece to deal with them all merkel s deal with erdogan was actually devised my mark rutte the prime minister of the netherlands because the commission council presidents weren t able to quite get turkey to be helpful aren t you one of those who believes that the eu governments should be more involved in decision making and not the eu institutions but you gotta admit that deal has certainly worked in reducing the number of refugees trying to get into europe especially attempting to enter without being processed first also despite the lies of brexiters no curtailing of eu values has taken place turkey still does not have visa free travel because it has not fulfilled the criteria despite the nightmare imagery ukip was trying to spread of 70 million turks moving to england from june in fact that deal has even encouraged turkey to offer better treatment to syrian refugees the turkish government is even considering giving some of them citizenship dave p s more to the point those eu leaders who did object to merkel trying to confront the refugee issue are also the eu leaders who are most adamantly against any kind of curbing of or brake on the right to freedom of movement do you really think you could get the poles for example to ally with england against merkel to push for a brake on freedom of movement this reminds me of the hysteria that broke out over the cyprus banking bail in where allegedly poor savers who d worked hard for years were going to lose all their savings that happen and cyprus is in a much better situation today guido g actually the reason we got here is because of the irresponsible borrowing lending and purchasing of italian banks and their refusal to do anything but the most minimal cleaning up of their mess cape you forgot to mention the pound cape oh is that what you call a dramatic drop in the value of the pound to 31 year lows in any case if negotiations had already started on 24 june why is hammond pleading for negotiations on individual issues to start more to the point henry foy s speculative claim that slovakia is following hammond s call is not borne out in anything the slovak foreign minister said the opposite in fact as lajcak simply repeated eu calls for official negotiations to start as soon as possible i e article 50 to be triggered where exactly does lajcak say that the citizens issue should be discussed before the triggering of article 50 he says the negotiations on the future of the uk and the eu must be led in the interest of our citizens and we understand that the uk political scene needs some time but we also hope the uk politicians understand it would be in no one s interest to have an extended period of legal and political uncertainty nothing in that suggests that he is following hammond s spin that talks on citizens in the uk eu could start before article 50 what he s saying is that those people s rights need to be respected in contrast with what theresa may has said and that the british should start official negotiations as soon as possible henry foy s pathetic reporting here is akin to the spin given to sapin and jupp s comments that everything will be on the table as they are prepared to discuss access to the single market without freedom of movement and please stop trying to fake some disagreement between the commission and the member state governments they are all united on this issue no negotiations before article 50 is triggered as for eastern europeans blaming juncker for brexit they re just taking the opportunity to bash him because they don t want to help refugees blaming juncker for brexit is even more ludicrous than blaming eastern europeans for going to work in the uk for brexit notasocialist you d be better off working out just how much tax and other contributions slovaks pay in to the british economy why don t you give the figures for how many slovaks are claiming benefits in the uk i bet it s very few slovakia like most western countries doesn t need to offer housing benefit because it s only in the uk that housing is so ludicrously expensive the uk should also change the right to receive benefits for those who ve never worked in their lives there might be less of a benefits trap and the workshy natives might have an incentive to work they can start practicing working when the arrival of eu citizens in the uk slows down to a trickle and the country finds that it doesn t have enough people willing to do the work that needs to be done surveyserf it s continued to shine in the sunlit uplands of the minds of some but i believe the clouds will finally close over their vision blinded by the brightness of their imaginary sun the pouca i think for european science foundation esf you mean european research council erc then there are all those commission grants erasmus marie sk odowska curie this still doesn t explain why people who feel left behind voted to leave the eu it simply confirms that leave voters have very little grasp of what the eu is or does even worse they admit that their leave vote was nothing to do with the eu but just a sign of dissatisfaction with the british government although they had the chance to vote for a bigger spending labour government in last year s elections and didn t moreover they are unable to assess that voting to leave the eu is against their interests as the country will now become poorer and weaker what this claim about the poor left behind who are annoyed with the elites and hence voted leave suggests is that leavers didn t think through the issues properly and are just searching for an excuse as to why they rejected the eu the real reason is that they have been told for the past 40 years that everything bad that happens to britain stems from the eu with such a flimsy grasp of the significance of eu is they voted very superficially as for the flood of people who are not like them are poles so different please stop trying to claim that isn t xenophobia exactly how many eu migrants are there in the west country why did those regions with the highest percentages of migrants vote to remain now your relatives can expect a flood of poor migrants from the undeveloped world to staff their local nhs hospitals they should also ask themselves why britain was one of the only three eu countries that didn t impose a seven year moratorium on freedom of movement from the new eu countries in 2004 englishrose no one in my other son s class at school in white except for him interesting except one presumes that none of your son s non white classmates are from the eu which begs the question why theresa may never bothered to do anything to reduce non eu migration people voted to leave because they were presented a deliberately confusing set of frightening images which jumbled up migrants from the eu with non eu migrants from the third world syrian refugees and muslims this was a pernicious tactic but it worked if they voted leave to keep so their children s classrooms would not be majority non white then they willingly allowed themselves to be fooled by the dog whistle politics of the leave campaigners now they can expect increased non white migration from the commonwealth a policy many leavers were so happy to push in order to make up for the loss of much needed labour now that england will be less attractive for eu citizens so uk fund managers will have to have to apply to and receive the approval of the dreaded commission and the dreaded eu institutions the commission will have to approve of england s new legal and supervisory regime ensuring that uk firms are able to do so ought to be an important component of any exit negotiations i think the rights of uk firms to access the single market will not be a part of the exit negotiations but of the trade negotiations that will take place once england has withdrawn but what about other third country funds not uk funds who have thus far used the uk as a base for access to the eu single market brexiters seem not to realise that it s not just about uk firms accessing the eu but about all those from around the globe who based themselves in the uk because it was in the eu have the brexiters given any thought at all to these important issues if so what do they intend to do apparently they have and they claim to have the answers it s all fine nothing will change everything will stay exactly the same it s all fine england is dreaming how fast british politics can move while the nation itself rests at a standstill after brexit brexit hasn t actually happened yet just wait for that moment there won t be any rest johnnie1820 the two years of negotiations after the triggering of article 50 will primarily be about britain s withdrawal from the eu after this will come the negotiations on what england s relationship with the eu will henceforth be kissmehardy ken clarke i doubt ken baker was the best prime minister we never had friendly yank brexit means that the west is seriously undermined sun carriage who knows a brexit might be seen as a smart move after all i seriously doubt it although the almost sounds like an admission from you that brexit is not currently being seen as a smart move an india england trade deal is years and years if not decades away if england has an eea efta like settlement which you continuously advocate then its trade deals would be pretty much dependent on the eu anyway but sure carry on dreaming that there s going to be some kind of rebooted commonwealth which will be of more value to england than the eu single market oh please this vote is nothing to do with brexit and the fidesz government takes great care to make sure that only referendum questions it agrees with are put to the people any hint of a petition they don t like gets sniffed out immediately as for integration viktor orban is one of the biggest pushers for an eu border guard i e the borders of external schengen members being patrolled by eu guards not just a national guard hardly an attack on greater integration hungarians are more likely to boycott this referendum which has an incomprehensible question than deliver a resounding no the opposition parties are already calling for a boycott and political analysts in hungary are ridiculing the question more to the point the question touches upon the hungarian parliament having a vote on quotas hence it gives the right to the hungarian parliament to vote in favour of quotas if it wishes to do so trying to interpret the internal politics of eu countries through the prism of english attitudes will always lead to gross misunderstandings let s also not forget that it s apparently eastern europeans that the english don t want hardly grounds for a common view with english brexiters does this refer to eu citizens who are in britain today or does it also include eu citizens who will move to the uk between now and whenever the actual brexit takes place the same question goes for british citizens in the eu ian campbell journalists are meant to investigate not propose policy solutions that s the job of politicians the job of journalists is to check their claims check the facts on the ground and hold politicians accountable as well as report on what s actually going on yellowjoe sure let s ship over filipinos from 10 000 miles away to work picking fruit for a few months rather than have poles or romanians who are just on our doorstep and hence far more flexible you re obviously not aware that every eu member state is a christian heritage country timothy reay wages will fluctuate if the pound is slipping against the home currencies of the seasonal workers glad to see you ve at least noted that these people will be doing minimum wage jobs though those eu haters who like to bash juncker should also take note of what else lubom r zaor lek the czech foreign minister said at a meeting with the other v4 foreign ministers slovakia poland hungary and their german and french counterparts the decision by the british people in a referendum is a serious matter we regret it but at the same time it is something that cannot and will not halt the future development of the european union we agreed at our meeting today that the eu is a project that we badly need for our lives and we are ready to do everything we can to ensure that project carries on successfully http www radio cz en section curraffrs uk exit must not halt eu progress says zaoralek after prague v4 plus meetingjuncker is an easy straw man the only point barber is right on is that he isn t going anywhere eastern european countries are criticising juncker because they don t don t like the refugee quota plan and he has threatened to reduce the money that they are given by the eu if they don t pull their weight to help the eu face this difficult crisis blaming juncker for brexit is even more ludicrous than blaming eastern europeans for migrating to the uk as being the cause of brexit some voices in berlin may think jucnker jumped the gun but some other voices in the german government i e the spd were even quicker off the trigger in telling britain to leave as soon as possible scourge of the economists eastern europeans are only attacking juncker because he has threatened to reduce the money the eu gives them if they don t help out with the refugee quota plan they see brexit as an opportunity to undermine him but that s a bit like saying that eastern europeans are to blame for brexit because they insisted on migrating to the uk svejk schweik because to access the single market it will have to a contribution but the rebate britain currently gets will be scrapped judyw sure judy the entire eu will grind to a halt for a few years just for the sake of one country that claims to want to leave all those essential activities within the poorer eu countries that depend on eu funding can just be abandoned even things like european research funding which many british universities are reliant on can just be flushed down the toilet academic voice you seem to forget that the only ones who need a negotiation is the uk it s the situation of the uk that is changing and the uk that needs a deal for the eu it s just an irritant and will increasingly be seen as such rather than as something drastic for the eu the longer london dilly dallies musso it doesn t matter what the conservative party is willing to accept or not they have absolutely no leverage and they don t even know what they want musso the point is if you refuse freedom of movement then how are you going to ensure the movement of goods or capital if the people providing those can t move how can you ensure freedom of services if the people providing those services can t move to provide them rooksmarlboro lastly letting every poor individual and refugee in from africa and muslim countries is not freedom of people can you actually explain what these people have to do with the eu they re not eu nationals so the principle of freedom of movement does not concern them dilly wow the arrogance continues guess what the eu economy even minus england is much much bigger dilly this man is an mep sure he s just an individual mep and of a smaller party grouping and doesn t have that much power in himself although he is a fairly influential mep but in this interview he s not speculating or giving his own opinion he s spelling out the rules of the eu access to the eu s single market is not possible without freedom of movement at some point brexiters are going to have to accept this as a fact the uk government can ask its electorate what it likes but if the eu don t like any of those proposals they can simply reject them you also seem to forget that the eu market minus england contains 460 million people and the eu also sells to the rest of the world tit for tat tariffs won t really be that much of a bother certainly not enough to destroy the fundamental principles of the eu barnard he means not everyone is a bigot not everyone agrees with you that immigrants are not welcome in england washu wow brexiter arguments get even more ridiculous now not only do they want to put off the day for withdrawing from the eu as long as possible not only are they demanding that they retain eu rights for as long as england remains in the eu those nasty eu rights that they otherwise condemn as diktats and undermining english sovereignty now they want to keep eu institutions in england washu oh please what is parasitic about eu nations seeking to host eu institutions what is parasitic is a country that wants to be outside of the eu yet believes it should be the host to eu institutions or imagining it has the right to have access to the eu s single market without respecting its rules porteno you write as though this comes as some surprise to you it has always been absolutely clear that no country can have access to the eu s single market without accepting the four fundamental freedoms one of which is freedom of movement leave campaigners who claimed that england post brexit could put curbs on freedom of movement of eu citizens and still have access to the single market are liars it s outrageous that they were never called out on this either by journalists or by remain politicians but she has insisted that britain should not invoke the eu s article 50 triggering formal divorce talks with the bloc until at least the end of the year this gives britain the time it needs to negotiate an orderly departure except there will be no negotiations until article 50 is invoked it s also very doubtful that there will be an orderly departure theresa may will find it hard to spell out precisely what she plans to do as access to the single market means freedom of movement there is no in between fudge at least gove is honest that he is not interested in being part of the single market although also a liar and a fantasist this article completely misses the point if the uk leaves the eu and scotland then leaves the uk to become an independent country then it can apply to join the eu as such there will be no transitional period with some kind of automatic continuation of scotland in the eu but an independent scotland could join the eu very quickly oh please the longer it takes for england to trigger article 50 the worst it will be for the uk the uncertainty over the uk s status will be prolonged not the uncertainty over the status of the eu27 the only reason gove may want to hold it off for as long as possible is because gove wrongly thinks there s going to be some kind of pre negotiation negotiation while may is too scared about what s going to happen the next eu enlargement round was always going to be years and years away anyway the results of elections and plebiscites in other countries won t have any effect on the uk talks the conditions will stay the same single market access only with freedom of movement uk unable to negotiate trade deals only once it s fully out of the eu talks on a trade deal with the eu can only start once britain is out of the eu the only slight difference could be if spain puts together a government that is less hardline on the catalan issue and hence more willing to be flexible on scotland s membership of the eu but that would only precipitate the breakup of the uk sun carriage if the uk takes up an eea arrangement that is enough to make such talks viable but all the tory leader prime minister candidates ruled out an eea arrangement by ruling out freedom of movement even if we for just a moment accepted your fantasy as being a possibility it s still something that won t happen for at least another three years the merchant adventurer oh please you obviously have no idea how university research funding works or how university research projects operate if you really cared about uk research and uk universities you would have listened to british academics and voted to remain again yet another example of leavers wanting to remain in the eu for as long as possible and derive all the benefits it offers for as long as they can at least you acknowledge it offers benefits what does not kill us makes us stronger as gloria pointed out i think it was donald tusk who said that that s what his father always used to say lovely wishful thinking by the way being in the eu is about much more than just the city aside from the eu and nato being two different and not completely comparable things you seem to be overlooking the fact that it s the uk that wants to leave the eu messenger i always said the pound would plunge and it has it s real effect beyond being a safety valve is to make britons poorer i m also of the opinion that the full impact of a british exit from the eu would only be fully apparent in a number of years although there will definitely be more short term destructive consequences with article 50 and an actual exit naivesheep day one of what day one of a british exit that hasn t happened yet if you mean the first day after a leave vote i don t know of any expert who said there would be immediate disaster on 24 june although i don t recall it as being a particularly good day for the pound or for british politics the full effects of a british exit from the eu will only start to be seen a few years after article 50 has been evoked and britain has left looking at the facts there is nothing to suggest that this will be good for britain and everything to suggest that it will be bad metrodorus the younger the uk has existed in roughly the same form for 300 years britain had a huge empire for much of that time until after the second world war the empire was a really big part of british and imperial life yet people today seem to have deliberately forgotten all about it although the sense of superiority and notion that the whole world revolves around britain still exists in some oh and the weird idea that australia new zealand and canada are all just waiting for us to come and join them in a big anglo gang in just a few decades britain lost all its empire so things can change very rapidly for the united kingdom even the united kingdom could cease to exist in its current form the other important fact about the empire is that it gave britain a huge market to operate in that natural market disappeared and so britain shifted its focus to the natural market right next to it what is britain s natural market going to be now christopher c brexit is forever it s not just for a few months in fact it hasn t even happened yet let s see how things are in 5 10 15 years time this is kinda ironic considering the violent and on occasion deadly attacks thus far tend to have been by white racist thugs against people of immigrant background including hungary s fellow europeans the poles or people who fight racism such as jo cox edoroshi can you explain why if britain chooses not to remain in the single market and hence not have the passporting right this is apparently the eu acting like children wow so a company that had already decided before june that it was going to open a base in the uk is continuing with the plans it already had the question is what decisions will us and other foreign biotech companies make about in 2 5 10 years about where to open a base in europe we will just have to set up a small extra office in whatever european city the ema moves to a bit more than that you will have to comply with all eu regulations in pharmaceuticals but have very little if any influence over how those regulations are developed and no access to policy makers and regulatory authorities bobby r oh is that from the daily telegraph of course it s good news the ft has most certainly reported on this do a search but have you even stopped for a moment to consider what equivalence means it means that the uk regulatory system will always have to apply eu regulations and be approved by eu regulators it also means greater costs and bureaucracy and uk based enterprises still being locked out of some sectors it also means since any non eu country can aim to apply the mifid ii regulations that the uk loses any advantage it may have as if for example australia applies an eu equivalent regulatory system then australian banks can just operate out of australia they don t need to come to the uk for equivalence but it s fascinating to see a hard core brexiter like jacob rees mogg saying the uk must hurry up and implement an eu directive http www bloomberg com news articles 2016 09 20 brexit backer says bank freedom starts with embrace of eu rules the u k should ensure that the eu market rule overhaul known as mifid ii enters into force as intended in january 2018 to avoid complicating the government s talks on secession from the bloc said jacob rees mogg a conservative lawmaker in parliament s treasury committee and an outspoken brexit supporter hangonaminute one individual isn t deciding what a bizarre distorted vision of the eu you have this is a negotiation between the commission representing the eu and empowered by the eu governments to negotiate on these matters in keeping with the eu treaties and the swiss plazidus that sounds more like racist profiling to pick out potential irregular migrants rather than a border check just goes to show how stupid profiling is christopher c lucky you i fly to geneva quite often i always go through passport control when you fly into geneva from within the schengen zone are you actually asked to show your passport at security when you board your plane or at border control in geneva klog actually 4 eu cities appear in that list of top 30 global financial centres and the eu even has the top one london it s the very fact that the uk has been in the eu for 43 years that has made london the world s top financial centre all commentators who argue that london can remain the world s top financial centre after a british exit from the eu also underline as does this rather confused article that all britain needs to do is replicate eu regulations in other words it is by implementing regulations that are exactly like those the eu has that london will be able to maintain its top spot even an arch brexiter of the crudest kind such as jacob rees mogg believes that the uk must implement eu regulations now and have them in place in the event of a brexit if london is to maintain its pre emninent status http www bloomberg com news articles 2016 09 20 brexit backer says bank freedom starts with embrace of eu rulesthere is a huge weakness with the replication argument however in that it is just not the same as having full single market membership and passporting rights it also raises costs and bureaucracy once we re outside of the eu it will become plain to even the most fervent denier that being a member actually reduced red tape moreover the eu can decide to change or adapt its regulations and britain will have to follow yet with no say over what changes are made but an obligation to implement them too which raises the question just what is the point of leaving the eu then especially from the perspective of one of britain s globally leading sectors if a we will still have to replicate eu regulations and b stating that britain will need to replicate eu regulations in order for london to maintain its leading global position is an acknowledgement that the eu single market is vital and that london s main attraction is its current access to the eu a question if mifid ii allows banks and companies based in countries outside of the eu to operate within the eu as long as their home country has a similar regulatory environment then presumably over time any country could adopt a regulatory environment that is equivalent to that of the eu and their banks could therefore operate within the eu without necessarily having to set up an eu base so the uk would have no advantage over australia the us switzerland or norway or even places like the uae if they adopted eu regulations too the uk s only advantage at this point in time is that it is currently already in the eu and hence has already adopted eu regulations it s the very fact of abiding by those hated regulations that gives the uk a head start i find it funny that brexiters who usually foam at the mouth at the concept of eu directives are now falling over themselves to declare their love for the markets in financial instruments directive ii directive even jacob rees mogg is saying it should be adopted in full as soon as possible sleepwalking to oblivion listening to the nonsense spewed by the brexiteers it makes me wonder how this country has ended being so successful during the past twenty years eu membership has helped in fact many eu countries have stupid politicians who are saved from oblivion by eu membership if anything needs changing in the eu it s getting national governments to stop behaving like idiots bbb yes but fico also has the backing of 26 other eu member states geneva the 48 voted to remain in the eu remaining in the eu requires accepting freedom of movement hence the 48 accepted freedom of movement i m a brexiteer get me out of here you clearly haven t understood what the eu defence force is about but since you re a brexiter why would be expect you to get anything right alan were we not told repeatedly that brexit would bring an immediate slump no more importantly brexit hasn t actually happened yet tony islington brexit is such a jobs training opportunity doctors nurses care home workers builders engineers tech start up it people farm labourers hotel cafe and restaurant staff there are going to be so many new positions for british youth angelus i bet if there had been a 51 9 vote in favour of remain you would be making great efforts to show how this isn t a true majority it was only a narrow win that was only secured because of project fear and the effort for a new referendum should continue it s all about me grovel said he expected turkey to join the eu by 2020 draw your own conclusions even more fun boris johnson arguing in 2009 that turkey should immediately join the eu and become its centre deveron being able to make a few good calls in your own narrow business sector is not the same as having a goo understanding of how the national economy works but i wouldn t say basing forecasts for 12 18 and 24 months time on the basis of a couple of good summer months is a good business call shanker singham expresses the full british arrogance towards the eu and as a result gets it all wrong this sort of idiocy is what is going to ruin britain the eu cannot be allowed to think it is britain s only game in town he says but the eu knows the rest of the world exists but the eu is next door it s in the same town whereas all the other countries are on other continents the main point however is that britain is what s not the only game in town and the eu is a much bigger prize than the uk will ever be hi sebastian you might want to read an interview published today with tomas prouza the czech eu affairs minister we could consider him the counterpart of david davis to get a bit of an eu view you know the other side in this attempt to find a way to get the uk out of the eu this is the bit i particularly love one thing is the lack of understanding by at least some of the ministers the second problem is that there isn t enough willingness to believe what the ministers are being told by civil servants they re being told things they don t like i wonder which ministers he could mean http www bloomberg com news articles 2016 09 08 u k brexit goals completely unrealistic top czech envoy saysthe u k s current proposals for a post brexit agreement with the european union are completely unrealistic as britain must grant access to workers contribute to the bloc s budget and submit to legislative oversight to keep single market access the top czech negotiator said a lack of understanding by at least some u k ministers over how the union works and unwillingness to believe what they re being told by their civil servants is contributing to contradictory statements from london tomas prouza state secretary for eu affairs in prague said in an interview wednesday there s a lot of frustration among the eu leaders because what you sometimes hear from london is completely unrealistic said prouza who leads the czech efforts to prepare for an eu without britain and is contact with colleagues in the u k and other eu states they will have to give up on some things the very basis of diplomacy is reciprocity and that s something they need to understand one thing is the lack of understanding by at least some of the ministers he said citing discussions with people in the u k involved in working on a brexit strategy the second problem is that there isn t enough willingness to believe what the ministers are being told by civil servants they re being told things they don t like i m very curious if the brits will be able to say that the bank of england will still be supervised by the ecb and the european banking authority prouza said but unless they do that i don t see any reason why we should accept passporting for an institution about which we have no idea how well it s supervised anything after march and we ll see the goodwill toward the u k diminishing very quickly he said if there s no notification by march what we ll see is the eu meeting much more in the form of 27 and trying to plan for the future without the u k they shouldn t be meeting hammond they should be meeting davis johnson and fox to explain to them just what britain stands to lose outside the single market sun carriage you ve obviously never done business using the euro count dooku but was it also a correction to an overvalued pound as you also wrote in which case to what degree was it overdone an overdone correction count dooku it was overdone but welcome so it was welcome to overdo it p s don t forget the concerns over a protracted political crisis which the tory party leadership competition seemed to be pointing to david best the real problem has always been and will continue to be migration from former british colonies aren t they also known collectively as the commonwealth i e that collection of countries that brexiters were arguing britain could do greater trade with outside of the eu of course any putative trade deals with commonwealth countries will also come with demands for visa relaxation easier migration etc but australia new zealand and canada are ok even though they re not as white as they used to be and aren t quite the oases of anglo culture that brexiters imagine them to be armchair economist the token gestures of investment by the eu are the result of what local politicians do with the money if local politicians are unable to plan and use that investment wisely it s not the eu s fault but at least as you say the eu made a few token gestures when central government apparently didn t it s strange then that the local population believed london based politicians such as boris johnson and voted against the eu hounddog oh no not big banks banks are evil falmer apparently 8000 manufacturing jobs were created in ohio last year so perhaps that worker could try and find one of those jobs or they could still work in manufacturing but in new industries such as 3d printing a new report details how

asset_map_of_additive_manufacturing_neo_final pdf this would require imagination and an aptitude to be open to new ideas and new ways of doing things and creating new opportunities which is hard for

setting up shop in the uk if they don t have passporting rights into the eu which they won t if britain s not in the single market besides i m not sure that many eu citizens or even british citizens would necessarily see it as britain holding some cards if the country has to turn itself into a tax haven bobby r is the value in sterling terms of 0 9 of food sales the same as 0 9 of retail sales note also that the food sales rise covers the period june august it would be interesting to see what the breakdown for august alone is for some reason this article suggests that the food sales figure is only for august although elsewhere i ve seen it written that it s for the three summer months but what happened to all those foreign tourists who are flocking to britain woolwich you mean lovers of anglo saxon exceptionalism such as nicolas sarkozy and sigmar gabriel or do you want to tie the uk s fate to marine le pen and frauke petry robbo can you point to any concrete fact or proposal davis made aside from that britain will not be in the single market prominentfrogman it s not just that it s unachievable it s also detrimental to the economy dean armond there already is an official opposition led by corbyn and it s rubbish particularly his so called leadership on the issue of britain leaving the eu betterfuture the far right ukip nationalism racism attacks on foreigners the electorate believing mindless junk has effectively won in britain pg oh but his department also has 120 staff in brussels although one wonders who exactly they are and what job they do wee johnnie only farage and the daily express barry manga you mean you recognise the figures md8058 describes as real people that could mean she takes a very tough stance on migration and one that enrages eu partners if the quota system is set too tightly why would it enrage eu partners any british migration demand will have to be agreed to by the eu27 and would be reciprocated britain will also lose out by not being in the single market and then japanese businesses based in britain may decide to transfer their head office function to continental europe if eu laws cease to be applicable in the uk no wonder natwest branches now look like cheap rubbish after the recent renovation 4194 the two year timeframe from the triggering of article 50 will not include negotiating a trade deal between the eu and uk these two years will be limited to negotiating and planning britain s exit from the eu and what kind of relationship it will have with the eu afterwards only once that has been accomplished will any negotiations for a potential trade deal between the eu and uk what s left of it begin so the reality of the situation is even worse especially if you consider that the process of exiting will be much more complex than anyone in britain realises donlas it s interesting how no one even bothers to mention sterling as a major currency anymore barry manga to weaken london s grip on fx trading even more southafricajack aside from the fact that ireland won t be in the eu and that would completely destroy its economy those multinational companies didn t set up shop in ireland solely for the sweetheart tax deals but because it s in the eu the issue isn t that ireland is a low tax location but that it offered apple a special deal that no or few other companies have even in ireland apple wasn t simply paying low tax it was paying next to no tax the netherlands is another country that has similar questionable deals hence the no comment remember when the world s then biggest rock band u2 used to pay almost no taxes in ireland their home base because they were artists when the irish government changed that particular law u2 went and set up their tax arrangements in the netherlands despite the fact they had nothing to do with the country this was at a time when they were campaigning to get governments around the world to write off third world debt so tax payers would have to pay for that while they avoided paying tax martinarcher i don t think you understood in the eu you still pay tax based on your residency or where your activities are u2 set up a company in the netherlands even though they are not resident there nor were any of their business activities solely to pay as little tax as possible not out of any feeling of european solidarity and this they did only when their home country decided it had to start paying them tax for their business earnings of course there is nothing illegal about what they did but it s pretty unethical and also a taxation loophole that should be closed harlow man it s not actually against the law eu english napoleonic whatever for private individuals to have whatever opinion they want about a particular crime and those accused of it it s the state and the justice system that has to treat them as innocent until proven guilty regardless arkadiusz j wik was attacked and killed by someone in harlow harlow man how are the disaffected youth of harlow doing pleidiolwyfimgwlad it s funny that david davis today declared that we will have control of our borders in the uk from the one place where there is no border control or passport checks at the same moment that he was also saying that there will be no hard border between the uk and ireland stockwell but i thought everyone in the north east was suffering and depressed and hence voted brexit also it s fascinating that everyone is now acknowledging that cameron and osborne might have done a good job on the economy and that british membership of the eu is actually good for the country given that the apparent boom is something that was put in place before 23 june bing perhaps 60 of eliza s sales are to the eu and require single market membership otherwise the bureaucracy and red tape the irony that will be incurred for a small business will be too great and make exporting a non starter but hey it s interesting that a brexiter claims to know more about eliza s business than she does herself what s pretty awful though is how brexiters simply dismiss real life examples of how damaging a british exit from the eu will be with popular discontent with the eu still high in france germany and italy is this an accurate statement i don t think so and certainly not for germany moreover discontent with certain aspects of policy is not the same as discontent with the eu something people in the uk never understood part of the reason for this stupid brexit vote which has incidentally led to increased support for the eu in the eu27 it s also possible for member states to have different opinions without this meaning that the eu is split one thing the eu27 are all very united on however is that a brexit deal should not undermine the fundamental freedoms of the eu including freedom of movement and that s the populations too not just the so called elites arthashastra yes britain does well when it s in the eu teamgb wins when britain is in let s see how well teamgb does one or two olympics after we re completely out of the eu and the country as a whole is impoverished and has less money to invest in sports again british research does well when britain is in the eu let s see how well british research is doing when uk universities are no longer part of eu research networks and funding british universities can no longer employ academics from the eu as easily and fewer eu students study in the uk i wonder how many of the authors of those academic papers are from eu countries dark pool yes let s have an independent un enquiry to discover what really happened with mh17 oops that s already been proposed but was vetoed by a permanent security council member i wonder what they re scared of and so don t want a un enquiry alfred nassim alfred let s have a un enquiry on what happened to mh17 ob and orban is also misleadingly confusing refugees with economic migrants although both are a form of miasma to him orban would probably prefer that eu nationals didn t move to hungary but he likes his own citizens to be able to work in germany so that they can send remittances back home if you are a rich bahraini though the hungarian consul in that country is permitted to sell you hungarian citizenship even if you are a muslim although for a good price the author of this article seems to be deliberately ignoring the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were already attempting to make their way from syria and other countries to europe under the most horrific conditions long before what he misunderstands as an open borders policy was announced how can someone who claims to be an expert on refugees ignore everything that was happening prior to september 2015 he also overlooks the fact that the alleged open borders policy was about dealing with the hundreds of thousands who had already ended up in europe it was accompanied by efforts to reach a deal with the most logical nearby country to the syrian refugees turkey in order to prevent those people from making their way to europe in those kinds of conditions does collier agree that turkey should be helped to deal with the syrian refugees or is he simply going to repeat jordan jordan jordan as the magical solution which is the only alternative suggestion he ever gives in his shallow analyses i wonder if he s even asked the jordanians what they think in any case since britain now has very little influence in the eu and has an opt out from this area of policy no one cares what theresa may says which is just as good because she s not actually saying anything but yes let s just dismiss the 1951 convention as simply a us cold war tool let s forget about the horrific situations in which tens of millions of refugees find themselves in throughout the world and pick on europe oh no stefan oh no let s panic gosh how hypocritical considering the spd have been pushing merkel to go further in accepting more refugees archimedes the great majority of eu countries voted in favour of this policy only a handful 3 of the v4 didn t pastaneta sure expel the illegals which you need repatriation deals for which merkel seems to be the only one to have managed to push any through but help genuine refugees and they had to use paper maps to find their way there paper maps are still 100 better than digital maps especially for finding your way around in an unknown city isherwood s berlin sounded creepy with a great dollop of impending doom and i don t think he intended it to sound like a great playground except for adventurous gay men at a time when homosexuality was illegal in britain other than that it s not clear just what point this article is trying to make yes britain is now psychologically cut off from europe but young europeans aren t in limbo only young britons funny because there s another article in the ft today by an actual german telling us that germans are in fact responding to these incidents rather calmly don t forget twitter trending may have nothing to do with real public opinion but is the result of a concerted and coordinated campaign by special interest groups i wish arguments about what is described as merkel s open door policy would put things in their proper context millions were already trying to get into europe before last summer and it is this that was causing havoc but europe could not get a proper response together because some small new eu members don t like brown people merkel offered to take in the extra numbers that were in hungary and other countries which were unable unwilling to deal with them she wasn t saying every syrian and arab come to germany this was also part of an overall effort that would involve new repatriation deals with countries where there is no great political conflict so they can hardly claim to be asylum seekers e g morocco patrols in the aegean and mediterranean with the assistance of nato to stop people smugglers and cut down the flow of boats stronger checks at the eu borders with the creation of a new border force and a deal with turkey to have syrian refugees and others there rather than push them in to europe richard everson since they are only at 15 they would need coalition partners who do you suggest that would be in any case the afd wouldn t sort anything out just destroy eco510 you must know by now that stefan is always incredibly concerned to tell us just how terrible everything is in germany he s so very very concerned also headlines related to germany are usually nonsense jojo why would she she s the chancellor would you ask if the prime minister of the united kingdom has to compete for a flat or donald trump i doubt marine le pen has to christopher c if this article had been written about berlin 2 3 years ago the main reason being given for rising rents would have been the thousands of young people from all over the world going to live and work there because it s fantastic for artists and tech start ups i guess it still is the reason since most refugees aren t actually looking on the housing market but are in refugee housing but great convoluted argument according to you nasty germany has a low wage culture so rent rises would lead to higher wages house prices are rising in berlin but this is not very popular but according to your argument rising house prices would lead to rising wages are you saying then that a rise in wages is not very popular in germany ooh another concern story from stefan wagstyl clearly the answer is for bustani and tim to flat share that way they could get a nicer place much bigger than 40 square metres and pay significantly less rent per head each month they look exactly the same anyway so i m sure they d get on well seriously in which major city anywhere in the western world can people in their early to mid 20s afford a great flat all on their own especially when they aren t even working the fact that young people in germany are still in a position to even contemplate this simply shows that rent in germany is much lower than most countries however the industry is rapidly losing skilled craftspeople through retirement and a shortage of young german recruits a great argument in favour of migration bahiano too subtle for you was i in more simplistic terms despite all the rubbish about how syrian refugees are alien to germany and will destroy its culture in reality there is very little difference between a young german man and a young syrian man in terms not just of their style and fashion sense a form of self expression but also their aspirations in life this was more apparent when the article was first published and rather than the scary looking image of a german flag with weird humanoid symbols with suitcases somehow symbolising feared waves of anonymous migration i presume the larger version of the pic of bustani and tim standing side by side smiling was at the top cookham where did i say anything remotely like it s a bad thing and must be ended but thanks for underlining my point that the situation that wagstyl is apparently so concerned about is the norm in the entire rest of the western world but you know what will really push housing prices up in germany the fact that there aren t enough skilled builders and not enough young germans willing or able to learn to build much of the world is in trouble and in much bigger trouble than europe the eu is only dealing with the problems that are being thrown up by the current historical conjuncture it s funny that all these books are by brits only britons seem to think that the eu is a project that has some kind of grand overall aim that can be proven wrong or right rather than a practical daily necessity in order for the people in this part of the world can get on with our existence dave maljoffre s intention is always to propagandise for russia e scrooge on the contrary chancellor faymann was a big fan you also seem to have forgotten the fact that the austrian government voted for this policy at eu level and you misunderstand the issues that the austrian government is critical of which are more complex than how you ve simplistically misunderstood things namely they actually support the refugee redistribution programme and think other countries should also take their fair share moreover they would say that their problem is with the lax patrols in italy and greece but a squabbling coalition and a misplaced need to sound tough has meant that they ve messed things up a bit e scrooge here s faymann a few months ago http www reuters com article us europe migrants iduskcn0rc0gl20150912 austria s chancellor criticized hungary for its handling of the refugee crisis on saturday likening the country s policies to nazi deportations during the holocaust as refugees complained of their treatment in the eastern european country erm no this meeting is more of an embarrassment to kohl christopher c does your government do such audits myweehoney the visas free entry for the schengen area is an open invitation for turks to migrate to europe can you actually explain this to me i can enter the us without a visa just as americans can enter the eu without a visa this doesn t however mean that i can work in the us remain in it for more than 90 days and become a migrant there the same goes for americans travelling visa gree to the eu so please explain just how visa free entry to the schengen area means that turks can migrate to europe christopher c hi moscow resident myview the european parliament would vote overwhelmingly to support refugees gac it s amazing then that at the eu summit last week all 28 heads of state and government voted for it gac why should the eu insist on that the eu said it has nothing to do with finding a resolution to the cyprus problem and doesn t want to be involved they wanted the problem resolved before cyprus became a member they didn t set that as a condition however because a the greek government threatened to veto the membership of the other 2004 entrants if resolution was made a condition b at the time it seemed that the greek cypriots under clerides were serious about finding a solution and it was thought that if resolution was made a condition that would strengthen the turkish position in the end under papadopoulos with his delusion of getting turkey to do whatever he wanted even though he could never quite outline what that was was the one who rejected the un solution while the turkish cypriots rejected it similarly they have not set resolution of the cyprus problem as a condition for turkey s membership negotiations with turkey on the refugee issue should be about just that nothing to do with visas or chapters similarly negotiations to resolve the cyprus issue should be about just that not trying to involve all sorts of other issues such as turkey s relationship with the eu or the refugee issue vetoing the opening of chapters for reasons other than the actual object of the chapter but simply because you want to annoy turkey does not help the greek cypriots nils de graaf according to the un the proposed plan does violate international laws on asylum you should be satisfied rather than complaining alternatively europe desperately needs a coherent refugee policy and it needs it right now that could be the other conclusion from the summit if the german public is so opposed to assisting refugees then why are the greens and the spd who are even more pro refugee than merkel apparently beating the cdu christopher c chris c i know you claim to be british but your writing style and the content of your comments gives the impression that you re not more like you re in a moscow warehouse or something i would love to have read that article but it is impossible to read online being in the ft s new digital strategy format i e gimmicky awfully laid out hard to get information from and generally unreadable at least there are big facebook and twitter buttons at the top further underlining that gimmicky clickbait is the point not contemplative reading remember the brouhaha when hannelore kraft won in north rhine westphalia well she didn t exactly win but her coalition had enough seats to make her state governor remember the pirate party jonathan m there was no spiritual presence of hungary slovakia poland or even the czech republic at the vienna meeting the vienna meeting was an attempt to find a solution to the refugee problem however misdirected whereas the v4 are all about bigotry against aliens the v4 were deliberately not invited the vienna meeting was also a demand for the rest of the eu to take in their fair share of the refugee quotas it s not against the schemes coming from brussels and berlin the only difference between the berlin brussels actually eu council decisions and the vienna meeting was the proposal to close the greek border which will trap migrants refugees in greece the austrians would say that the greeks aren t doing enough to process who is coming through and that is true on the other hand this won t make it any easier for them what austria is saying is we have taken in more than our quota share of refugees now it s the turn of other eu countries to do so begnins yeah that s really a viable solution except for the fact that australia doesn t have wars in syria and iraq within literally walkable distance begnins now they can get boats for a short distance the point being that it s a short distance or they can go through thrace greece and turkey have a land border you know the point being australia doesn t have explosive wars in its general neighbourhood judge barbier why since the majority of entrants into greece are women and children hufnagel don t forget the threats of the foreign minister defence minister and former citizens protection minister to send the jihadists to europe cedlondon actually berlin has been trying to get greece to patrol its borders better for ages and even to have joint patrols with turkey since none of that happened merkel managed to get both countries to agree on nato patrols since they are both members and that should be starting in the next few days hopefully wenren are you aware that the electorate voted merkel in as chancellor three times and is still currently supports her party as the largest party in germany judyw here you go again showing your ignorance of european parliamentary systems seriously judy you sound very silly when you come out with this kind of stuff actually i d wager if there were a presidential system in germany today merkel would perhaps win it the spd are even more enthusiastic about refugees than merkel so any spd candidate would be well to the left of her on that issue in presidential systems voters are usually aware that they can t agree with a single candidate on absolutely everything but germany as most of europe has a parliamentary system which means that whatever policy is passed goes through much more thorough debate by elected officials and is presented by a government consensus it s not the will of one individual stop confusing a presidential with a parliamentary system it s part of what make you say silly things about european politics charles smyth germany flew about 140 afghanis back home yesterday mr orban may have been the primary instigator of the anti eu and anti berlin revolt on migration policy but he s finding friends yesterday s meeting in vienna of 10 countries on the so called western balkan route produced an agreement that could bottle up tens of thousands of refugees in greece considering that hungary which it would otherwise have been logical to invite was excluded from the vienna meeting i don t see how on earth the vienna meeting can be described as orban finding friends i m not sure which eu migration policy you re referring to the primary and lone instigator of the failed revolt to upturn eu migration policy is the uk which wants to restrict migration within the eu primarily to block out eastern europeans such as orban s countrymen what you really mean dear peter is refugee and asylum policy mr orban doesn t want to settle syrian refugees in his country because they are muslim and he believes a few thousand muslims will alter the supposedly pure cultural make up of hungary this is hardly the same as what the countries that met in vienna yesterday are proposing indeed as we read elsewhere in the ft today serbia one of the countries present at the vienna meeting but which is not even in the eu has proposed taking on a quota of the refugees simply because it s the right thing to do and in reality is no real problem for european countries note this is serbia a country that certainly wasn t very nice to its muslim population a couple of decades ago if the serbs can offer this then shame on orban just looked hans thomas tillschneider up he s barely a local himself having been born in romania as part of the german community there one wonders who the afd will form a coalition with if it s in the position do so in any of the states that will have elections next month the cdu under merkel is working with all its strength to replace our nation with a population cobbled together from all the peoples of this world hans thomas tillschneider an afd candidate in saxony anhalt told the merseburg rally funny it wasn t that long ago that she was being accused of trying to impose the fourth reich upon europe funny how babi makes no mention of uber controversial czech president milos zeman considering he passed comment on so many others a decent journalist would have noticed this omission and asked babi about it or just asked him about zeman anyway jans spahn needn t worry too much since greece finally got a big shove up the bottom actually to do what it had agreed to do and nato is getting involved numbers entering greece fell to a little under 60 yesterday now all we need is for the other eu member states to take on their fair share of people fleeing destruction murder and mayhem and we are on our way to having a common european refugee policy it s ok jans you don t need to get so histrionic econwatcher i bet you if you checked the figures you d find most rapes in the pat year in austria were committed by white austrian men as for your demands for vetting the failure there was with countries like greece and italy which have not been doing their job properly funny that they also have anti merkel governments they however would counter that they haven t been getting much help from the rest of europe and so there is too much of a strain for them the answer is a common european refugee asylum and external migration policy where the burdens and responsibilities are shared by all of course migration doesn t just bring burdens and responsibilities it also offers an economic boost and allows a society to become more diverse sophisticated outward looking and attractive econwatcher i don t think there s any evidence that the police are covering up rapes by white europeans because the police don t actually feel the need or have the obligation to publicly announce evert single rape that takes place so i m not sure why a rape by a muslim should hit the national news on the other hand rapes by white europeans far outnumber those by muslims in europe yet you don t get outraged by those judge barbier any figures on how many young boys have been raped in europe by white catholic priests in the last few decades or last few centuries as for the germans you speak to strangely despite this supposed massive rise of the twittish afd to 12 the overwhelming majority still back pro refugee political parties jan you must be overjoyed that your naive article the point of which is not clear except for career advancement purposes is encouraging the exact kind of vitriol you claim to be worried about poachedwonk yet judging from the media coverage one would imagine that the 52 apprehended were all syrian refugees comment the overwhelming majority appear to be from places like morocco and algeria therefore they are not refugees at least merkel got a repatriation programme going between those countries what a load of nonsense the current syriza anel government is completely incompetent in pretty much all areas as pretty much every greek will tell you and has as a matter of ideology been lax on border controls similarly it is over 3 months late with the hot spots it had promised has barely installed passport inspection and fingerprint machines and has useless border staff except they protest about how difficult it is to patrol greece s island borders yet up until yesterday have refused all help with patrolling their borders greek servicemen and women are doing the best they can but are being let down by their useless government of course greece isn t the only cause of europe s migration problem italy has also been shockingly lax and the refusal of certain new member states to accept any refugees creates a huge burden for the other countries but it s a pretty big source of the problem as for troika micromanagers who exactly are the micromanagers from berlin they re actually refusing to go to athens because the syriza anel government s pensions reform proposals are such garbage they don t see the point the greek government on the other hand is absolutely desperate for them to visit athens so it can get its next cash instalment as for economically devastated greece don t forget they get loads of money from the eu to help with the refugees as for the hypocritical commission the eu commissioner for migration and refugees is the representative from greece more of this open door rubbish there was never an open door policy that said everyone just walk over here and we ll look after you germany s offer was to take in those refugees who could go nowhere else this would be combined with not automatically accepting as asylum seekers or refugees people from the balkans and now morocco algeria and afghanistan as well as other countries such as pakistan the aim is also to get stronger repatriation deals in place which germany alone seems to have been making an effort to do another aspect was precisely to keep syrians closer to home namely in turkey hence the 3 bn euros and turkey would be encouraged to do what it could to stop the people smugglers the other important aspect is to create processing hotspots in greece and italy although unfortunately both countries have been dragging their feet on that and greece has been particularly irresponsible jordan has many industrial zones some near the camps if new jobs were brought to these zones by european companies refugees and jordanians could take them in agreed proportions and this is collier s great suggestion sure opel and philips could go and set up car and technology factories in jordan and employ 10 million syrians who ve never done anything like that in their lives exactly how merkel is supposed to encourage private companies to go and set up facilities in jordan is never explained seems to me paul collier is making it up when he claims he s spent a year studying the issue because he seems to have thought little very about it it s also not clear to me how having a supposed open door policy towards refugees is meant to boost a politician s domestic ratings since encouraging migration especially of muslims is never popular in europe collier also seems to ignore the fact that the cologne etc attackers were not refugees but from countries like morocco and algeria let into europe by ineffective checks in italy and greece germany has now put in proper repatriation deals with those countries harry lime the uk and republic of ireland have border free travel between them are you suggesting they should erect borders controls and passport checks obviously you don t live in a schengen country otherwise you wouldn t say anything as daft as that peter spiegel misses the point as usual what faymann and seehofer and even gauck argue is that the rest of the eu needs to accept quotas and take in refugees as well plus greece and italy finally need to get those hotspots and processing centres up and running more to the point immigration numbers aren t the same as refugee numbers entrants from algeria morocco tunisia and elsewhere trying to claim asylum need to be kindly told to go back home unless they truly are brave bloggers criticising backward attitudes who are being threatened and in fear for their lives for examples syrians and iraqis need to be prioritised currently everyone from italy and greece through the balkans and central europe has not made any effort to return fake asylum claimants from north africa but has simply tried to funnel them through to germany via austria wolfgang sch uble who in november warned of an avalanche of refugees because of careless government actions more untruths from peter spiegel sch uble warned of an avalanche of refugees as a result of globalisation which european governments were not prepared to do anything about in that interview that spiegel didn t bother to report properly he was supporting merkel s policies i m not sure where spiegel found the careless government actions quotation but schauble apparently said in translation that migration was a rendezvous of our society with globalization and that the pressure of migration was something that could only be solved at a european level or it could go quite badly for all of us also nation states can no longer resolve these big issues not quite what spiegel makes it appear like http www dw com en germanys sch uble likens migrant wave to avalanche a 18844624as for whatever gerhard schr der might be saying it s his party that s trying to push merkel into an even more pro migration line moreover the problem with open borders isn t caused by germany but by greece and italy here again the biggest push to get those countries to have better checks on entrants and set up processing centres is merkel merkel hasn t cancelled davos she wasn t going to start with and why would davos in a week s time have anything to do with anything that happened two weeks ago the cdu is at 35 in the polls and the afd on 11 5 i didn t realise that the cdu was still germany s largest party i thought they must have dwindled to about 18 20 in the polls and the afd were at 30 from the foreign media reports we re hearing as for north african and arab looking men from what i can tell the only person making an effort to get the governments of algeria afghanistan morocco and elsewhere to accept their citizens back when they are repatriated from europe for having entered illegally is angela merkel syrians and algerians aren t the same thing just as an american like peter spiegel isn t the same thing as a european an aspect that had become unclear in recent days but is essential for germany to continue funding athens again the german obsession imf involvement is essential for every eurozone country to continue funding athens and the us is absolute on that point too kristalina georgieva is indeed a good candidate for un general secretary and a great european commissioner she s also a fervent supporter of an eu refugee and asylum policy exactly right especially the last two paragraphs thus far athens new 86bn bailout programme has been chugging along comparatively smoothly this is a joke right athens is keen to get the review closed quickly so that it can get to the politically popular debt relief discussions athens is dragging the review on and on as it is trying to avoid pensions reform and no one in greece is duped about syriza s debt relief claims funny that there is barely a mention of the imf in this article and that an irrelevant one the fact that tsipras is trying to get rid of the imf which doesn t get a mention here belies spiegel s claims that greece s new bailout is chugging along smoothly just yesterday the finance commissioner moscovici was telling greece not to play games with the imf thank god spiegel is leaving brussels soon not soon enough though this is all true sort of what really needs to be established before full conclusions can be drawn is was this as the police and politicians have suggested an organised plot if so what was its purpose to undermine the refugee policy and cause ethnic tension were the vague and unverified threats of an attack in munich a distraction for something else other issues also need to be clarified such as which national groups have the right to asylum from what i ve understood the german government s refugees welcome extends to those whose country is at war and there are no safe spaces in it so syria iraq and eritrea others are not automatically awarded asylum just last month merkel arranged a repatriation programme for entrants from afghanistan so all those asylum seekers from afghanistan should just be returned i m not sure what the situation is for moroccans but they are certainly not on germany s priority list for asylum seekers there are many pieces to the refugee and asylum seekers puzzle aside from refuge and all eu countries to share the burden we need a european border and coast guard repatriation agreements migrant processing hotspots in greece and italy intelligence activities and operations against people traffickers turkey to start doing its job properly and much smarter counter terrorism policing than we ve seen thus far rather than turning against those in genuine need the new year s eve attacks should be a spur to getting that eu asylum policy in place and for the eu to act as a whole a pedantic point but the nasty three who raped two underage girls were not refugees at least not in the articles i read christopher c what a load of nonsense the paris attackers were born and bred in paris and brussels syrian refugees for whom there is still no real evidence that they were involved in these attacks against women were trying to get into europe for months sun carriage no they said they d be willing to take in refugees not migrants why would these attacks effect this policy considering those involved from what we know so far do not appear to have been refugees sun carriage i don t agree with you aside from some hysteria from certain countries that don t want their white homogeneity sullied but want their own citizens to be able to live anywhere in the eu there hasn t been that much opposition to the refugee policy of course this is precisely why the internet brownshirts fill the comments columns and why this unfortunate incident is being distorted lied about blown up out of all proportion so they can create opposition but the problem will still be there millions will still be trying to escape the horrors in syria they ll still be trying to enter europe and unless some way of dealing with them is found their dead bodies will wash up on the shores of greece and turkey you say migrants because you don t want to sound nasty by saying you oppose giving refuge to those escaping war bombardments starvation rapes beheadings but that is what you are doing swap i don t agree what you are doing is saying people under threat from the islamofacsists in syria should not be given refuge but should stay there and be killed by them brutto erm it s not actually known who the attackers are so you can t call them immigrants they may not even be north african or arab let s not forget that german police didn t take seriously the murders of a large number of ethnic turkish men residents of germany because they believed that these were simply the product of inter ethnic conflicts when actually they were carried out by neo nazi terrorists the wholesale condemnation of the sexual attacks by the german political establishment hardly suggests that they have been silenced the mayor of cologne is really speaking out the one who as a candidate for mayor was stabbed in the neck by a racist for her support for refugees charles crawford just imagine if a uk government announced it was going to sack all the employees of the bbc within three months of a new media law taking effect as the polish government has just done as for trots and hard leftists in reality the pis government is a continuation of the authoritarian communism they grew up and came into adulthood under it s all they know and they can t comprehend any other away of doing politics new hill but the hungarian media watchdog is indeed controlled by party appointees after the outcry to their initial proposals fidesz made some cosmetic changes the members of the monitoring authority aren t appointed by the prime minister as in the original proposal but by the president who is himself effectively appointed by the prime minister moreover the president makes his appointments on the recommendation of the prime minister you may be surprised to learn that this is true but since you are so outraged by the claim that the hungarian media authority is controlled by government party appointees you should also be outraged by the fidesz government since this is indeed the situation they have created http merlin obs coe int iris 2013 4 article17 en html new hill fidesz no longer has a two thirds majority in the parliament the media council is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister it s not put to a vote in the parliament in any case two thirds majority in the parliament was only ever about 26 of the electorate in terms of votes for fidesz they do have a coalition partner you know and what happens when you have a government with only 52 of the seats in parliament by the way i thought neoliberal was meant to mean something like thatcherite it s a stupid term in any case but i don t think you ve comprehended what the backers of this term seem to mean by it peter spiegel brings his american view of europe into play with the infantile dominoes theory since greece has no border with any schengen country and to get to the rest of the eu via greece one has to cross several non schengen non eu countries of course there will be border checks along the way much more fun would be for him to report how the speaker of the hungarian parliament a close ally of viktor orban recently claimed that neither the czech republic or slovakia should have been allowed into the eu because they had thrown hungarians and germans out after the second world war or slovakia s harsh criticism of the new polish government s recent raid on the nato affiliated centre in warsaw domino nix01nick doesn t have any claim to fame even as an ft commentator he appears to be a new troll who s signed up just to bash merkel wuppimon these people were already trying to reach europe anyway just look at the figures for the earlier part of the year mack88 people fleeing bombings isis and assad are refugees not economic migrants 24720 afghanistan and pakistan are on the list of safe countries so no they don t get in as refugees what is this nonsense wagstyl is going on about about an open border policy what merkel and many others are saying is that genuine refugees should be welcomed but greater efforts made to prevent economic migrants from places that aren t being torn apart from entering europe irregularly the rest of the policy that eu policy that is being developed by merkel the commission and the more responsible countries is that there should also be stronger patrols on eu borders in fact by an eu force there should be more thorough processing of those attempting to enter europe with processing centres and hot spots set up in greece and italy people who aren t genuine refugees will be deported there are also attempts to keep more people feeling syria in turkey and to really tackle the organised crime gangs behind the people smuggling overtaxed yes let s say that to poland and slovakia which don t want any syrians and what about indigenous britons who haven t paid any or enough contributions shouldn t they be expected to contribute before they start receiving benefits harry lime no you misunderstand perhaps deliberately perhaps because stefan wagstyl is not a good correspondent people seeking refuge are entering europe whether you like it or not what they re leaving behind is a 1000 times worse then your opprobrium their towns are bombed to smithereens they are under threat of death from violent lunatics they didn t start coming because merkel offered them refuge countries like greece and italy have borne the brunt of these refugee entrants and as a result have been a little lax in proper processing procedures deliberately allowing anyone through and up to other parts of europe because certain countries further north were refusing to assist at all in helping with genuine asylum seekers merkel wanted to break the logjam by announcing with the agreement of her government and others in europe not just her own initiative that germany would take as many real refugees as it could the hope was that other eu countries especially those that expect germany to give them billions of euros each year would help with taking in some refugees each this policy was overwhelmingly passed at the european council with only a handful of countries which ironically are the ones that most vocifeorusl demand that their own citizens be able to migrate anywhere in the eu and expect eu handouts ever year objecting they were outvoted just as they hope that britain will be outvoted in its demands that eu migrants not receive benefits the other side of the deal is that greece and italy will patrol their borders better perhaps now with eu forces and set up processing centres and migrant hot spots so as to better process those attempting to enter europe in this new policy that s under development anyone who isn t a genuine refugee will be repatriated to their home country as far as i m aware it s an obligation accruing from international treaties to offer refuge to those in genuine need of it instead of demanding yet more cash from the eu sr saraki should be expending his energy trying to track down the billions of dollars that were intended to help the nigerian army fight boko haram but which appear instead to have disappeared into the pockets of sambo dasuki security advisor to former president goodluck jonathan otherwise european citizens may worry that their tax money is going straight into the pockets of corrupt government officials and perhaps a few senators and not to fighting terrorism and helping refugees http www bbc com news world africa 34973872great let s have more terrorist attacks to achieve growth what ferdinando giugliano overlooks is that france will get leeway on security and defence spending but will still have to sort the rest of its spending out according to the regulations they can t use this as an excuse to avoid reform the person telling them this is pierre moscovici fences are springing up along schengen borders what hungary s viktor orban was pilloried for initiating just a few months ago is almost becoming best practice slovenia is rolling barbed wire on its croatia border austria along the slovenian border within the schengen non eu balkan countries on the route up from greece are to follow orban didn t put a fence up on hungary s schengen borders but the border with serbia and he was criticised for the idea that a fence can be effective not for putting up a fence on a schengen border croatia isn t in the schengen area so slovenia s barbed wire isn t along a schengen border neither are the non eu balkan countries in schengen so no fences aren t springing up along schengen borders what s in schengen is greece but as this article at least points out it s not relevant that greece is in schengen because it doesn t share a land border with any schengen country schengen isn t going to break up for a few thousand refugees a day tens of millions of people cross schengen borders every day without the system breaking down what we need to do is strengthen the eu s outer borders and get greece and italy to accept eu patrols and eu processing centres at their borders so people not eligible for refugee status can be sent back before the go any further in the eu the polls by the munich based ifo institute that s all we need to know genauer because it s run by hans werner sinn who has long predicted the collapse of everything in europe and generally opposes everything the government does you can generally predict that anything the ifo institute predicts will be gloomy and negative and trying to undermine the german government s positions whatever government that is hi gideon please read this and try doing some minimal research next time considering merkel is the one who has been making the most effort to get turkey to control the flows to europe i d say valls has exactly the same position as her but of course you journalists not just yourself but your colleagues at the s ddeutsche zeitung like to twist things to create some drama http www dw com en confusion over french pm valls comments on refugees a 18875881confusion over french pm valls comments on refugeesfrench prime minister manuel valls caused a stir after reportedly telling journalists at a news conference on tuesday we cannot take any more refugees in europe that s impossible several publications including the german daily s ddeutsche zeitung repeated the french prime minister s quote as such but his office later issued a slightly different quote saying in a press release europe has to say that it cannot take this many migrants anymore that s impossible the confusion could however be down to something simply being lost in translation the original french statement can be interpreted as no more or not anymore leaving ample space for ambiguity securing europe s bordersregardless of either statement valls did not advocate setting any limits to migrant numbers he did however stress that refugees from syria should chiefly be dealt with in syria s neighboring countries europe has to look for solutions to take care of the refugees in countries that are neighboring syria anything else would put europe s capability of effectively securing its border at risk in the same discussion with journalists valls advocated strengthening europe s border controls following the paris attacks the prime minister said that having control over europe s outer borders was essential for the eu s future after it was revealed that at least two of the paris assailants had gained access into the eu country by using fake syrian passports france has long been asking for improved eu border controls the november 13 attacks in paris which killed 130 people only added renewed vigor to the demands pressure is also mounting on germany to stop the flow of refugees into the european union as several french political parties have accused german chancellor angela merkel s refugee policy of opening the european union up to many dangers valls said that germany and italy were also facing serious threats from the self styled islamic state is ss msh dpa afp musso i agree with you for once gideon also forgets that merkel has renzi on her side on this issue let s not forget that valls also made a rash comment and claimed the paris attacks were planned in syria then it emerged that the attacks were planned in the country he governs under his watch when a british semi eurosceptic such as gideon rachman claims that germany is being isolated within europe you have to laugh as for valls apparent statement that we cannot accept any more refugees in europe i would urge rachman to check his source since such a statement does not appear anywhere in the article that ft rachman links to as the source what we do read at that link is he urged european countries to act together to protect its sic borders reiterating that the bloc could not welcome any more migrants all of which is sort of correct to an extent europe should definitely protect its borders which means eu patrols and eu staff doing the migrant processing at the borders of greece and italy the creation of hot spots and processing centres we also need to get germany to stop funnelling people it can look after into europe this is in fact what merkel more than anyone has been urging but what rachman has overlooked is that there is a difference between refugees and migrants and i m sure that manuel valls follows the policy of his president who reiterated that france will take in 15 000 refugees over the next two years as for whether europe can take in more refugees some european countries actually need to as they have declining populations and birth rates and ageing populations so they do indeed need new migrants and there are plenty of refugees they could take in ironically they tend also to be the ones lashing out at the idea that they might accept 200 swarthy people into their lands yet vociferously defend the right of their own citizens to migrate anywhere in europe they want to go while at the same time expect germany to keep doling money out to them money germany has partly because it accepts migrants who fuel the engine of its economy the main point about refugees however is that they will continue to try and get to europe whether we want them to or not the point is to manage the flows since it s not possible to stop them suggestions that europe blockade turkey are about as realistic as jeremy corbyn suggesting that mohammed emwazi should have been arrested deveron no one s suggesting importing labour but accepting a few hundred refugees for those countries such as poland etc in order to relieve the burden on the larger countries the figure that hollande said wasn t the point the fact that he reiterated france s commitment to helping refugees is the point yes indeed the governments of poland hungary slovakia are objecting to people who are different i m not sure why those of us who don t think refugees should be left to die should apologise to anyone p s schengen is not at all under threat pro refugee politicians e g germans tusk say this kind of thing as a way of warning countries such as hungary that if all they aim to do is shove non eu migrants to germany then they will find themselves outside of schengen cole which poll gives her 26 which poll ever gave her 70 the only recent polls i ve seen put her approval ratings at around 53 not bad for someone who s been in power for a decade or even for a year judyw again judy spouts nonsense about things she knows nothing about now she s an expert on balkan culture the waste disposal habits of the refugees and the supposed fences that some politicians occasionally say they want to put up when making a populist play brussels isn t painting a rosy picture brussels is clear it s a difficult situation but it s our continent so keep your nose out especially when you don t know what s going on judyw what an appalling statement as if all residents of britain who are of non anglo saxon origin are murderous terrorists shameful judyw once again demonstrates her complete ignorance of european countries although she constantly pontificates about them not even the most racist briton would come out with such a nasty statement as hers above about the communities of migrant origin in britain nowhere in her visit to turkey did merkel offer the country eu membership alan sked s conflation of different issues to create panic and horror only makes him look bad he also overlooks the fact that current eu proposals backed by merkel are to put turkey on the safe list of countries so that people from that country wouldn t automatically be considered eligible for refugee status neither is merkel nor anyone in the eu placing all their bets on turkey as the solution to europe s refugee problem but there can t be any kind of way of resolving the inflows from syria without involving turkey since its to be the main transit route for the syrian displaced what is sked suggesting the we just send gunboats out to the greek seas to prevent any refugees from entering europe by the way isn t alan sked the founder of ukip judyw hilarious again judy proves she knows nothing about europe or the eu because the ep is not the parliament of europe it is a parliament that votes on certain eu issues but it is not the final decision making body the eu is not a single sovereign state and the ep is not the legislative body for the european people on the contrary the european council plays a bigger role comprised of the actual governments and heads of government of the eu member states and the european council did indeed vote overwhelmingly in favour there the quota most of the eu haters that judy is usually friendly with would be apoplectic at the idea that the ep is the democratic voice of the european people in any case as far as i m aware the majority in the ep is very much in favour of a supportive policy for refugees and the biggest driver for the eu s new migration and asylum policy is the other leg of eu governance the european commission erdogan has achieved nothing particularly amazing except the promise of some money and the speeding up of some processes that have been under way for years anyhow don t forget it is your hero viktor orban he s not very popular with the ep for example who is a huge proponent of giving turkey billions and billions to keep the refugees there as for merkel s trip to turkey whenever an eu national leader makes a trip abroad like this it s always in agreement with the eu institutions don t worry the majority of eu governments and the ep and the ec agree with her on this but if she succeeds she might yet become a candidate for the nobel peace prize that rightly eluded her this year not this nonsense again i don t know why supposedly intelligent people who are otherwise able to ask pertinent questions keep repeating it nominations for the nobel peace prize close on 1 february of the year they are awarded merkel s refugee policy only emerged in the late summer just a few short weeks before the prize was announced there was no way she could have won the prize this year and it s not awarded on the basis of a couple of discussions the week before the announcement perhaps constanze stelzenm ller could get a few of her colleagues together to nominate merkel before 1 february 2016 for next year s prize http www nobelprize org nomination peace makootage some canadians are francophones such as half of justin trudeau s family the one he was born into and the one he married into istanbul12 you mean merkel is the only person in europe that we should look to for some responsibility and action what will she do when x y z happens in a third country what will the prime ministers of italy or hungary do what will putin do assad do econwatcher you mean you agree with david gardner that turkey should have been more enthusiastically welcomed into the eu and sarkozy and merkel were wrong to put the breaks on turkish accession moreover if you agree with the last paragraph which starts maybe mr erdogan is right then you are effectively agreeing with erdogan and think that the eu is behind a plot to oust him from power greenjay except merkel just the other day said she doesn t support turkish membership of the eu the biggest pushers of turkey in the eu have been the british i believe why on earth should the germans impeach merkel she s still one of the most popular politicians in the country despite being chancellor for ten years and her party is still well ahead in the polls the germans are more likely to re elect her as chancellor previously liberal national capitals including berlin have joined hardline states such as hungary in calling for far tighter controls at the eu s borders as the reserve of goodwill among voters towards newcomers that emerged this summer started to run out the same inaccuracy is constantly repeated in the ft berlin s line was always for the tightest controls the principle is refuge for those who generally need it those who don t need to think twice before trying to enter italy and greece had a reasonable claim that they were inundated on the other hand they have always been extremely lax about who they let in the great step germany made was to say ok we ll take most of the real refugees off your hands but you have to tighten your borders however since you have proved unable to do so in exchange for helping you with the refugees you let the eu make the checks at your borders since you always bang on about how they re eu borders anyway nobby you re confusing the complex british asylum procedures with those of the eu in any case the legal conditions are being redefined the german by voting against the quota policy hungary has shot itself in the foot because the quota policy was about removing asylum seekers from hungary and placing them in other countries by not supporting the policy hungary has now found that it also has to fulfil the quota elected in by the majority of eu member states if they d voted in favour then they would not have had to fulfil a quota like italy and greece aren t the german but we know that they have a different cultural and religious background oh no how terrible people who aren t white and christian they must be a threat different is bad they must be terrorists let s clean europe of funny foreigners econwatcher is what you claim the situation is actually what the situation is or are you projecting the thoughts in your mind onto reality econwatcher how have his views been proved correct instantaneously reading the comments here you d think the cdu s standing in the polls was at 25 and not 39 and that merkel was hugely unpopular instead of still one of the most popular politicians in germany mki not really the point is to create a comprehensive eu migration asylum policy germany taking on the majority of genuine syrian refugees is the first plank in a policy that will see greece and italy s borders properly patrolled with eu forces and eu officers who ll properly document entrants which has not always been done by greek and italian officers other planks are to find ways by which get refugees to request asylum without going through organised crime gangs and to increase deportations this will be done in the arrival hotspots that are being created in places like greece and italy not according to the british system that you re used to which is why you don t understand what the proposal is another important aspect is military operations against people traffickers a policy that started just today 7 october once all this has been done the eu will be in a stronger position to deal with governments who treat their citizens appallingly thus making them try to get to europe europe not just germany already has a huge illegal immigrant problem the objective is to find a way to monitor it control it and make sure it helps those who genuinely need help while preventing those who aren t in such need from entering jack512 hasn t krugman been proved wrong on absolutely everything for example back in 2010 attacking obama for not having a large enough stimulus but praising china for its huge stimulus predicting that in the next few years china would be doing great while the us will be suffering greatly funny how krugman fans forget everything their idol says despite worshipping his every word at the moment he announces them gheorghe hagi obviously you didn t notice the word extra after the 250 million euros the eu isn t offering 250 million euros it s offering 250 extra million euros on top of what it already gives turkey but no doubt you d complain if the eu attempted to do anything to deal with the asylum seekers coming through turkey ealing putin isn t taking on isis he s taking on moderate opponents of assad because assad is his political client if at any point he targets isis it s only at instances when isis threatens assad presumably you also support us british and french airstrikes against isis are greek or even italian officials really opposed to this proposal or does it just make for a catchier scoop especially since peter spiegel s name is attached all tsipras has been saying the past couple of days is that the migrant problem needs a european solution hotspot doesn t mean anything in greek and the migration commissioner can easily explain the proposals to the greeks in their own language judyw have you actually seen the syrians in europe in real life or are you just imagining what you think they look like because i have seen them in real life in athens just days ago plonked by the authorities in squares and on patches of grass and there are indeed numerous women and children among them not just young men unfortunately some very small children come on judy and christopher tell us where you have seen the syrian refugees in real life and not just media photographs another point the greek commissioner dimitris avramopoulos is the commissioner for migration tsipras wanted to make him president of greece so again i doubt athens is that resistant to these plans which avramopoulos helped develop similarly the eu high representative federica mogherini is italy s commissioner and renzi fought to have her selected she is also heavily involved in developing these plans arriving at the european council alexis tsipras said european unity means sharing our responsibilities burdens and skills for our common future so i doubt athens is being that resistant to this plan matteo renzi has been saying for months that europe needs to share the responsibility for these waves of incomers so he won t really have much of an argument against such a common responsibility ditto malta orban and fico made a mess of things with their response to the quotas firstly hungary wasn t going to be included as a country that had to take a quota but as a country from which the refugees would be taken from and placed in other countries by his stupid response orban blew that secondly fico could have said ok we ll agree to take these 629 refugees to lift the burden from greece but in return we want stronger european policing of greece s borders derz but but this is an idea pushed by viktor orban surely you must agree with him judyw your new hero orban is pushing this idea the most especially over greece surely you entrust him with border control by the way no one cares what reasons you see about anything to do with the eu what s really hilarious as far as this ridiculous language about diktats goes is that hungary for example has been claiming for a long time now that hungarian military should go and patrol the greek borders isn t orban s unsolicited proclamation a violation of sovereignty in any case one of the next stages of the newly emerging eu asylum refugee strategy is to reinforce greek and perhaps italian border controls but in collaboration with greece and with greece s consent merkel is an advocate of this position and i wouldn t be surprised if orban becomes her greatest supporter on this issue ric sorry ric but the eu isn t going anywhere and will be around for a lot longer than you i don t notice anyone in slovakia arguing to leave the eu judyw erm the overwhelming majority of countries voted for this measure how can that make the eu an undemocratic body if 450 million people in the eu had been forced to follow the wishes of 50 million that would have been undemocratic bonis where does it say that 57 of the european population is against letting syrian refugees in the quota plan only concerns refugees by the way not economic migrants who will be sent back to where they came from as far as possible in any case they are here and coming here and we can t actually stop that these people have entered europe whatever efforts were made to prevent them the question is what to do with them once they re here considering they re refugees and don t have anywhere to go lukasharustiak i bet you if britain said we don t want to cede the right to have a say on something so crucial to us such as who enters and lives in our country therefore we want controls on how many czechs hungarians and slovaks enter and reside in britain orban fico and zeman klaus would be up in arms ric this measure was voted by 23 out of the 28 eu member states by qualified majority presumably you think democracy is four small eu member states deciding for the 28 including the largest countries i e 50 million deciding for 450 million christopher c is that what you suggest if a politician from a third country says something stupid eu politicians should just walk out of the room and that s going to help how do you suggest british politicians walking out of the room long gone are the days when eu officials would waltz into turkish ministries to rewrite laws when did this ever happen a hardcore within the eu including france and greece are implacably opposed and stuffed the process with near impossible conditions is this true about greece or is it just repeating old stereotypes which this article is full of the difference between the eu and turkey of course is that syria is right next to turkey so of course that s going to be one of the first places the displaced go turkey also appears to have a role in building up isis creating problems for the kurds and keeping refugees in nasty conditions as well as not doing much to stop human traffickers but since erdogan is apparently one of viktor orban s role models the other being putin perhaps tayyip could have a chat with viktor slakbas they are taking syrian refugees in jordan has something in the millions saudi arabia has about 500 000 but they don t call them syrian refugees judyw the eu must start now returning refugees why many in the eu are happy to receive refugees even cameron was pushed into accepting more by the response from the british people you re really truly clueless about what european people actually think feel and want aren t you maljoffre i totally disagreed with bush s war against iraq believing it was based on lies and was bound to lead to disaster the current us president barack obama was also opposed to that war what i don t get however is why you are using the us war against iraq as a justification and diversion from the behaviour of the assad regime do you think it s perfectly fine that assad has killed tens of thousands of his own people actually i do get why you re using it as a justification and excuse you re a pro putin america hater who has no real interest in the lives of the people of the middle east except as ammunition in your america hate njegos oh i d be delighted to hear maljoffre s answer as to whether he thinks it s perfectly fine that assad has killed tens if not hundreds of thousands of his own people do you dear njegos approve of assad murdering syrian civilians judyw erm abbot has said in response to the eu welcome for refugees that australia will take more syrian refugees in refugees aren t destroying europe racist bigots are shaming us though not you of course you re nothing to do with our continent judyw in the meantime radical jihadists are killing innocent syrian civilians and you say europe should just stand by and let them be slaughtered by the way what is this since we have no replacement whoever replaces assad will be up to the people of syria not you or we crc how ridiculous first of all the migrant plan has nothing to do with schengen secondly schengen is hugely successful and no one wants to get rid of it to get an idea of the huge value of schengen in practice since it s clear you ve never experienced it try and imagine if the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland were closed and you needed a passport to travel between the two that would cause havoc the euro also is a great success boosting trade bringing currency stability and pushing economies to modernise greece s problems are intrinsic to greece and nothing to do with the euro euro membership has brought economic stability and security to greece which is why there is huge support for it in the country by the way what is a bid idea david hexter why would they need to traipse anywhere they only started walking through hungary to austria because the hungarian government tricked and lied to them about the transport it was supposed to provide for them to get to austria why is schengen shot in any case if all the refugees want to go to germany and germany says it will accept them why does that create a problem for schengen crc if germany says it will accept them all then what s the problem with them crossing internal frontiers to get there especially since a whole new asylum refugee policy is being developed bankingcynic in what way is reality now biting because someone in the csu made a semi critical comment when it s the daily activity of the csu to criticise and bash bankingcynic the family of the poor child who drowned were syrian kurds living in horrible conditions in turkey they had initially applied to go to canada but weren t issued a visa because they were unable to produce one document which was impossible for them to produce considering their conditions mencken sure mencken i understand it s a right not a privilege i hope you don t mean that life in canada is a privilege not a right for canadian born canadians however i agree that the applicant must supply the right documents but often in refugee cases it s difficult for people whose city has been bombed or who ve had to flee their homes to have the right documents so sure canada should not be under any obligation to accept people who are in the direst of circumstances if they don t have the right documentation with them it doesn t matter if they end up drowning and washed ashore but canada being so far away from any hotspots and bordering only the usa doesn t find itself in the situation of having hundreds of thousands of refugees turning up on its doorstep we in europe do so for reasons of logic and reason which i trust i don t have to present to you it s pretty difficult for us to stick to these rules in the same way unless we want the drowned bodies to start turning up on our shores so while i respect canada s immigration laws and don t expect your country to change them in any way please allow me as a european not to be too concerned about them because we have something much better to deal with over here in any case i suspect that even in canada the requirements for admittance as a refugee are different from the requirements for admittance as a migrant mencken i think it s quite clear that in the case of the kurdi family their s was not a fraudulent claim thanks for the words of wisdom about european policy i personally believe we d have even greater problems if we don t respond to the refugee emergency mencken you might not be aware of this but the language the roma speak is very different to that of the syrians i know they re all funny darkies from some funny place over there in your mind but it s quite easy to tell the difference by i dunno something as radical as just speaking to them even just looking at them judyw judyw not european not even german and now she s deciding who should or shouldn t be german chancellor what the eu treaties should or shouldn t be we couldn t care less what you think judyw fulminate away you mean nothing to europe eurasius actually ethnic germans were refugees in germany but germany wasn t their own country they d been expelled from places like czechoslovakia and poland many germans from germany and austria who were often also jews but not always had to flee to other continents fact syria lies just 200 miles from the eu in fact just 200 miles from british sovereign territory their journey was supposed to take them to a new life in europe actually it was supposed to take them to a new life in canada highpeak how about i just want to live in my own homeland without bombs destroying my city and isis chasing me ziggy47 what mess did they make syrians fleeing from war and slaughter jojo according to your foreign minister the eu should go and bomb syria because that will apparently solve the country s problems at least she s aware that there s something pretty bad going on in syria which has nothing to do with country shopping even if she is proposing the wrong solutions schengen isn t the problem the problem is countries like italy and hungary who are deliberately not properly processing arrivals so as to sift out the economic migrants trying to enter europe illegally from the genuine asylum seekers fleeing war zones instead they ve effectively just let them all through to rush off to germany or sweden and this was happening before germany s announcement that it would accept all syrian refugees those countries should temporarily be suspended from schengen until eu run processing centres are established along their borders a lex multi kulti is not the same thing as migrants and asylum seekers multi kulti is about living side by side not together different values not the same ones nouser which heritage catholics and protestants burning each other at the stake fascism genocide what needs to happen is that asylum seekers be distinguished from migrants the problem with italy s search and rescue project is that it s encouraging migrants who are trying to enter europe for economic reasons not people fleeing a war zone pepin asylum and migration are two different things it s a bit obnoxious to say to people fleeing a war zone ok if we have to we ll take a 100 christians but we won t take any muslims even if they just escaped from being slaughtered now what the australian way is to pay the organised crime gangs to return it doesn t drag the boats back to e g vietnam sure the eu dragging boats back to syria or libya is such a good idea people trying to enter australia aren t fleeing a war zone and being attacked by their own government or isis i m wondering on what basis philip stephens has decided the people attempting to enter the uk at calais are asylum seekers and not economic migrants if they are genuine asylum seekers they can make an application for asylum in france or any of the other european countries they traversed to get to france the fact that they are insistent about entering britain and only britain seems to imply that their motives are other than asylum as for the comments of the un high commissioner one has to wonder just what the un is doing to resolve at source the situations that are apparently creating all these refugees since this is apparently a fundamental purpose of the un because the impression one gets is that the un is doing very little highpeak exactly gordons alive yes euclid tsakalotos chief greek negotiator did say a referendum was possible the other night in his speech in parliament tsipras said elections or a referendum were out of the question if the greek prime minister and the chief greek negotiator can t even agree or don t even know what each other is saying then how on earth do we expect these fools to be capable of agreeing to anything with the troika let alone implementing it does the greek government have a fixed opinion on a referendum or is it just whatever each member decides to make up depending on what mood they re in italy s disinclination to fingerprint these people and the over emphasis on how sad things are for them shows that the country s stance is part of the problem italy is encouraging illegal migration to europe and then demands that the rest of europe takes in the migrants they have encouraged to come they have seen their brother die in the desert and their wife raped in libya do you think they ll be forced to have their fingerprints taken by an italian police officer they will say if i want to go to sweden i will go to sweden how do we know their brother actually died in the desert they could be making that up just to get to sweden and unpleasant as it is just because your brother died in the desert in sudan doesn t mean you should expect that you can just turn up in europe and go and live in sweden especially if you refuse not to have your fingerprints taken plus your wife might not be raped in libya if you didn t travel to libya having paid a criminal gang to get you there in order to sneak into europe stay at home and build up your own countries billy wind urm eu law states that if an eu citizen wants to live in another eu country for a period of more than 3 months then they have to show that they have a job or can support themselves chapter iii article 7 http eur lex europa eu legal content en txt uri celex 02004l0038 20110616 christopher c what is ez and what quotas has it announced pinnochio funny considering the uk is probably the eu country with most non eu foreigners judyw look at how tony abbot dealt with the problem in australian and get on board and imitate his program before europe is overrun and its culture destroyed he paid the organised crime gangs australian taxpayers money to take the migrants back by the way you re not european and whatever happens in or to europe or its culture which is not yours has nothing to do with you lumbago is this irony hugh carnegy you mean by being independent nation states with some in the eu and a couple out most with their own currency and one with the euro some in nato and some out but all in the schengen zone in other words the uk splits up into four separate countries with completely different international relations statuses in the eu and different currencies but at least all in schengen habakuk sure sounds like a great suggestion with england as the equivalent of greenland and the faroe islands and scotland like denmark in the eu with scotland denmark as the most powerful and also in schengen now could you please explain again that bit about how the city of london could maintain its status if it follows the greenland faroe islands model thanks the real greybeard except no other member state wants to be in the outer ring that britain apparently wants to be in it will be there on its own i think the general european response and the hard time cameron had has shown that event to english eurosceptics also i don t think prodi was saying that in a positive way i think he believes a multi speed europe is a bad thing sorry but a handwritten letter allegedly saying i will be a paid informer for the communists and signed bolek is not evidence of anything except an attempt at character assassination good old stalinist style the institute of national remembrance is nothing more than a pis tool exactly how was he dragged into the fray are you suggesting that he doesn t believe the things he says nicki the irony is that the nationalist poles hate the russians and the communists yet they re just as authoritarian as they are if anything this is a step back to the pre 1989 era ric poland gets tens of billions just for being in the eu but what would you know about how the eu works from the polish information and foreign investment agency poland is the largest beneficiary of eu funding between 2007 and 2013 our country received over 67 billion eur from the eu s budget http www paiz gov pl why_poland eu_fundsexpect a similar figure for 2014 2020 this proposed new government sounds a bit like syriza so they will presumably do the same back flip the two hard left small factions are the parallel of the right wing nationalist anel in coalition with syriza which also very easily did a back flip nils de graaf nils would prefer yiannis varoufakis as his finance minister pinnochio exactly what i was thinking dave pollard unfortunately for you it s only two tiny hard left parties that want to leave nato one presumes dave polllard is still grieving over the disintegration of the soviet union karang i think you mean uncle braintov add to that this whole eurasian union thing the very reason why putin started attacking ukraine when that country refused to join is a big flop as well he s also creating huge problems for sales of russian gas and oil to europe a much more profitable market than china ealing erm i think it s nato that has said that russian troops are sneaking into ukraine oh and putin also thanked the troops for their great effort moreover unlike you even putin accepts the results of the ukrainian elections and does not consider the ukrainian government to be a regime by the way even the article you link to agrees that russia is involved military in ukraine stating while there appears to be much more compelling evidence of russian military involvement in ukraine it seems you are the one incapable of assessing the information that even you think you have understood yes ukrainian politics is a mess after so many decades of soviet rule and russia interference what would one expect this is precisely why its people want closer ties with the eu and do not want to join putin s eurasian union with the poroshenko government now on a 20 domestic approval rating compared to putin now on 80 the main and clearly unanticipated political outcome of the sanctions are you suggesting that putin has an 80 approval rating in ukraine ric eu membership eurozone membership schengen membership gay marriage all the things you hate what happens if the british people vote to remain in the eu however would the tory party really select someone as leader who had gone against the wishes of the people on such an important issue if britain leaves the eu far from encouraging other member states to leave it will only draw them closer together the dangers of hostile rhetoric by populist politicians will become clearer and the risks of leaving will become very apparent as england struggles post exit and loses much of its global status ironically marine le pen s calls for a french renegotiation and referendum are not a tactic to pull france further away from the eu but an opportunity for her to abandon what has been her policy up to now of withdrawal from the eu this way she can forget all her talk of leaving the eu and claim she simply wants a renegotiation of france s membership she knows that doesn t actually mean anything as cameron s renegotiation has shown but she can claim she has been tough and won some concessions while still keeping france in the eu indigo what does that have to do with the cranks in poland in what way does germany s refugee policy violate eu treaties and membership criteria as for lazy policy it s merkel who is making the biggest push to turkey to take greater responsibility for syrian refugees and trying to get greece and turkey to set up migrant processing hotspots she s also the one dealing most with foreign governments such as that of afghanistan for repatriation programmes for their citizens who end up in europe and making the strongest effort to get the list of safe countries to which entrants into europe can be returned expanded and clarified similarly the push for setting up an eu border and coast guard is not being driven by poland ric where does this article claim that putin is about to fall it speculates on the possibility of a government reshuffle ric big political changes doesn t mean putin s downfall moreover speculation among government critics clearly cites both speculation and government critics moreover government critics had speculated big political changes and suddenly a government reshuffle is possible still nothing about the fall of putin looking forward to your next football article simon judging from the photo mr putin visited his cosmetic surgeon again before his visit to china jayvees you seem very certain about what the people in the east of ukraine want could you explain because it s not quite clear exactly what they re demanding from what i understand a small minority in parts of eastern ukraine who perhaps identify more as russian than as ukrainian are protesting but they don t all seem to have the same demands or even any clear or specific demands one lot i believe are calling for a referendum for independence but not even putin is taking them seriously actually it would cause more problems for him nonetheless all this instability suits putin as it gives him an excuse to interfere in ukraine and do what he can to undermine the presidential elections on 25 may and people like you can come up with your but the people in the east don t want that lines in contrast to the isolated protests by masked men in parts of eastern ukraine with a russian population the protests against yanukovich and for closer relations with the eu had the support of people from all walks of life throughout the whole of ukraine and today i don t notice protests over the whole country asking for the return of yanukovich or for closer relations with russia let s say there was a referendum throughout the whole of ukraine as to closer relations with the european union what happens if 75 of the population votes in favour should the entire country s future be beholden to a small dissenting minority in one region which doesn t make up the other hypothetical 25 more likely a few single digit of the whole population do you believe that if there was a referendum in ukraine to join putin s eurasian union that the majority of the ukrainian people would vote for it and what would happen if these pro russia areas actually broke away from ukraine and joined russia that would weaken even more the pro russia element in ukraine and strengthen the ukrainian identified population which wants closer relations with europe not eurasia but you are right we should listen to what the people say before deciding for them which neither you nor thomas graham have bothered to do by the way the eu isn t an anti russia alliance i know andrew wood all these geostrategists deciding on what deals should be done between the powers without consulting the uppity people whose lives they are pontificating on thomas graham doesn t comprehend anything he just looks at a map and thinks well we can draw a line there maybe ringfence that put that over there fund that with that then shake hands he doesn t comprehend that this isn t about non bloc status for ukraine putin wants ukraine in his eurasian union no matter what yet all he has done with his clumsy actions is push the ukrainians even further from him and now many of them are starting to see eventual membership of the european union and possibly even of nato something never even contemplated before as an existential issue of life or death putin is also using ukraine as a springboard for his anti us vision of the global order where he is going to be the great founder and leader of an anti us aligned world system where oil is sold in roubles and there is a parallel internet this isn t a new idea that the sensitive soul has been pushed into but deep rooted idea in the strands of russian thinking that are dominant among the country s elites i think any opinion piece on ukraine or russia which doesn t mention putin s eurasian union should not be taken seriously don t_panic you d be doing a more convincing analysis of russian media if you were actually to look at the russian media in russian directed to the russian people and not the english language version the russian state puts out in its attempts to inform foreign audiences even more important an analysis of the russian state media being directed at the russian speaking population in eastern ukraine also how about an analysis of russian media laws media ownership censorship internet control for example what do you think of the new russian internet law that requires all blogs with over 3000 readers to register with the russian state and obliges them to correct errors as defined by the state or the law banning swearing in films music and art it s funny how those here chiding propagandist western media and defending the russian media which they only understand to be russia today don t have a clue about media control and censorship in russia anyone who truly believes in a free media would not be defending putin the reason putin didn t want ukraine to move closer to the eu is nothing to do with nato and all about him wanting to grab ukraine for his own eurasian union i wouldn t even expect prof cameron to try and explain why nato is a red line for putin it s a defensive not an offensive alliance but he could at least attempt to speculate as to why the former members of the soviet bloc who are now in the eu and nato ran off to join the west as soon as they could escape moscow s grip presumably however he still thinks that those nations shouldn t have decided for themselves as to their future moscow should have had a veto as he believes it should have over ukraine s future in any case eventual ukrainian membership of the eu would be decades away and is unrelated to nato membership prof cameron fails to note that the former soviet bloc countries that are now in the eu joined nato first so nato membership is not some kind of consequence of eu membership if putin thinks that ukraine joining the eu is a threat to russia s national interest and security then maybe he ought to think again because he is wrong the eu can t conduct its relations with other countries on the basis of what mr putin s mistaken paranoid and twisted views might be prof cameron contradicts himself firstly he tells us that the desires of the ukrainian protestors should not have been overlooked then he claims that russia should decide on which alliances ukraine should join why is it that china and india both emerging superpowers supported russia on crimea great april fool s joke mja76 because china and india didn t support russia at all on crimea they both abstained at the un vote which is hardly support for russia on crimea china has even made public comments that it doesn t agree with what s going on in crimea putin only managed to get 10 countries to vote with him mostly a rag tag band of autocracies but of putin s eurasian union comrades belarus may have voted with russia but lukashenko has already made it quite clear he s uncomfortable with the annexation of crimea kazakhstan abstained and didn t vote with russia at all the real issue however is not crimea but ukraine and it s very apparent who s acting like the arrogant colonialist there the only ones who don t realise that putin has weakened russia with this move and scored an own goal against his vision of a eurasian union are the putinista trolls who infest comments threads the russian people will wake up to this reality soon enough what a ridiculous article where does one start in analysing this nonsense there s so much it s not possible suffice to say russia hasn t been pushed around by anyone it is master of its own destiny russia s problems are of is own making and start when it tries to push others around such as its neighbouring states which it insists on seeing as part of its own territory or sphere rather than independent states with the right to decide their own future the invasion of crimea was born out of putin s frustration with the rest of the world s refusal to listen to him the invasion of crimea was born out of putin s frustration with the ukrainian people s refusal to obey his commands so he had to do something grand to humiliate and embarrass them and show everyone who s boss except all he s succeeded in doing is pushing the ukrainians even further from russia and made the european union and the west in general even more attractive to them putin was roasted for the so called gay propaganda law but numerous surveys show that some three quarters of russians agree with it and see homosexuality as a sickness or perversion this is a strange justification for putin s gay propaganda law so because three quarters of russians are of the stupid opinion that homosexuality is a sickness or perversion that justifies passing irrational and repressive laws that harm russian citizens because there are gays in russia whip up more hysteria and bigotry in the country and ultimately only end up damaging russia s own progress and advance as a society does brian aris agree that homosexuality is a sickness or perversion putin is amazing he still thinks he has the right to dictate to the ukrainians what they should do in their own sovereign state and kill off the potential for them to take important decisions for their future in the future he rails against the us for being imperialist and then invites obama and kerry to agree together with russia big power to big power what should be decided for ukraine wendellmurray must have been really upset in 1989 when the soviet system came crashing down he s probably outraged at the fact that the baltic states hungary poland the czech and slovak republics etc are independent nations with the right to decide their own future and join whichever international organisations they choose the idea that as soon as they could they ran off to join nato and the eu probably makes him seethe they should be doing what putin tells them dammit of course in wendell s analysis all that is the result of us machinations not the free will of the peoples if those countries had been able to really choose for themselves they would have stayed within the sphere of russian soviet influence wendell see that little country lithuania it s a member of nato and the eu and its people are very proud of all that with the us suggesting what seems like a joint us russian demilitarised protectorate in the ukraine in exchange for russian withdrawal from the crimea not only has gavyn davis misunderstood what these talks were about he seems to be living in the wrong decade or even the wrong century the ukrainians decide for themselves what their future is and there is no such thing as a protectorate anymore this is a pathetic article tom elliott doesn t know what he s talking about putin hasn t achieved his aims the opposite he has made it more likely that crimea will separate from the rest of ukraine in which case he will have no leverage over ukraine even if crimea still remains part of ukraine all he will have achieved is to have increased the opposition even hatred towards russia on the part of the great majority of ukrainians perhaps tom elliot didn t hear of the crimean assembly s vote to join ukraine and its declaration of a referendum in ten days at the time he wrote this even so it was apparently obvious to anyone with a brain which international investment strategists apparently don t have that things were moving in this direction putin s goal was less about preventing ukraine from joining the eu than in forcing it to join his eurasian economic union the ukrainians will be even more reluctant to do that now and this has all just exposed his union for the sham it is if crimea joins russia then putin can forget about ukraine joining his union and that was always his real goal ric i thought as a eurosceptic you didn t believe in the concept of a european army ric erm no russia has been saying slightly different things most people have been aware for a long time that there s a grey area between turkey and isisbut funnily russia had no interest in turkey s fuzzy relations with isis until putin fell out with erdogan now they re friends again i bet you putin will forget all about his claims genauer don t pay any attention to habakuk he s one of those coordinated trolls i told you about they re all sent out to try and destroy merkel because she represents strong liberal europe and they re all putin trump assange followers sometimes paid on that note it s funny that maljoffre disappeared when i asked him what part of europe he s in despite him popping up to post every time you posted something so he was definitely around then maljoffre hey maj are you in europe maljoffre europe isn t threatening and humiliating europe beyond a few hysterical headlines but not being in europe you wouldn t know that maljoffre erm no merkel hasn t humiliated anyone certainly not europe it s not clear who she was supine and spineless especially since as even you point out turkey doesn t have its visa free schengen travel yet in any case since turkey is the path to europe for most refugees and migrants then some deal needs to be in place with turkey to stop them from entering irregularly i notice you ve never offered any counter proposals despite thinking you re so informed on everything genauer majoffre is one of those types who seem to think that just because turkish politicians spend much of their time talking crap europe should start talking crap and shouting and ranting too apparently shouting and ranting are a sign of strength judyw you think that the eu will pay 6 billion to turkey and let them have visa free access to ship out some migrants this isn t happening and i don t think you have a clue what s happening genauer the problem with 95 of the ft kommentariat nowadways is that they are driven by racist hatred and not by numbers and interest i think some of them are professional trolls whose sole purpose is to come here and rant and try and push their pro puting anti western anti liberal anti globalist or whatever their word is agenda we don t really need to take them seriously especially given that most of what they say is junk articles by stefan wagstyl tend to bring the hysterical out in them because whipping up hysteria seems to be the sole purpose of his journalism the funny thing is even these trolls seem to be having second thoughts about their former new political leader trump guyintoon i thought it was one member one vote i presume not all members are men skeptical1 don t forget the lib dems patrick c not to mention how messy it is to empty them olaf von rein under what trading conditions will he sell his products in asia outside of the eu england won t have any trade deal with any asian countries or with any country regional bloc ealing much of isis success in syria is due to the power vacuum created by the fact that the dictator assad is unacceptable to many syrians yet they are unable to get rid of him as would happen in a democracy because your hero putin and iran keep propping him up isis exploits the gap created by the disconnect between the people and the brutal ruler they do not want these latest maniacs are not syrians hence the us would not have been supporting their presence in syria your implication that all syrians who oppose assad are terrorists is reprehensible the zeus turkey hasn t got 6 billion euros from the eu the eu will spend 6 billion euros in turkey to support the refugees remember them is advocating the shooting of commenters within ft guidelines john lepire not much would happen because trump wouldn t be able to a get the cia to obey him in violating international law and all concepts of ethics b find any ally countries willing to assist him in this coi many things are said by politicians which will never be done so trump is just rabbiting out stuff that he has no real intention of ever doing njegos well dear njegos all the european ones were given safe passage out of the eu because who exactly they were and what there intentions were weren t known to eu governments so why should turkey know what other countries citizens were planning in any case do you remember the good old days when vlad putin and erdogan were best friends i m sure you d never have considered raising any criticism of turkey then njegos most of the names on the list are of individuals who crossed the turkish border to join isis in 2013 in which case they had to cross their own eu national and external borders so if eu governments didn t know what they were planning why should the turkish government know how about all those chechen muslim members of isis presumably they had to cross russian federation borders to join isis owl if corbyn makes abandonment of trident policy labour will lose so many seats in england it will be impossible for them to form a government regardless of what the snp does tamerlane this is a really funny post thanks for making me laugh christopher c what s the statement on russia over these executions has putin condemned them there s no doubt that some of the effects of this power are turning them into something we would recognise as a corrupt autocratic system said one western intelligence official who follows isis did anyone ever expect them to be fair transparent liberal and meritocratic sun carriage you mean he s an idiot njegos why i don t think anyone s ever claimed it s all assad s fault there is an argument to be made however that by propping up assad because his regime would have fallen earlier if they hadn t helped him russia and iran helped to create the conditions in which the turmoil in syria continued hence allowing the isis vermin to spread if russia and iran had pushed for a political settlement and a transition that didn t involve assad three years ago we wouldn t be in this situation today now the priority is to defeat isis and then work out a political solution for syria when the situation will be much more fraught than it would have been three years ago assad will be out of the picture anyway thumbscrew no cameron isn t painting anyone who s against the uk bombing syria a terrorist apologist he just used that term for corbyn because corbyn is a terrorist apologist and always has been tobias smollett what s shoddy is the idea that jeremy corbyn has had any positive success on any level and that he isn t destroying the labour party an article in the ft that claimed that is what would be shoddy journalism judyw so you re in favour of increased us bombing in syria chicagopol ever heard of the ira eta the red army faction 17 november red brigades and the war in the balkans which as this article points out led to an awfully large amount of weapons being available but obviously what happened is the collapse of the middle east which has led to destabilisation of a sort here too captain willard 1million immigrants have not been allowed free passage the headline screaming figure of 1 million has not been reached this year on the other hand 100s of 1000s of people are fleeing the horrors of syria and iraq and trying to enter europe for refuge and have been for some time regardless of what anyone in the eu says the answer is to provide refuge to those in genuine need and prevent those who aren t or who wish to harm us from entering this would require a coherent eu migrant and asylum policy with eu inspectors on for example the greek and italian coasts hot spots and processing centres and coastal patrols as well as efforts to combat the people smugglers if we don t try and impose some kind of coherent system then the actual facts on the ground or sea will remain the same but things will be much more chaotic and far more dangerous in any case the main problem isn t letting the darkies in it s european citizens getting out learning to murder in syria where they have murdered far more muslims than europeans and then coming back in again steven123 it s doing fine schengen has been reinforced by moves to tighten our external borders which should have been done ages ago and more information sharing will hopefully avoid the type of intelligence failures we saw this past week as the french interior minister said further integration on these issues is vital in the prevention of further terrorist attacks i mean it s not as though french police were doing border checks with belgium last friday and let salah abdesalam and his friends just drive on by christopher c yeah keep banging on about turkey but the turkish authorities apparently gave the french intelligence info twice about mostefai one of the murderers in the bataclan club but the french authorities didn t take it seriously enough major offensives have to be planned properly it s not just about smashing them with bombs just because donald trump thinks so the model of supposedly representative but hierarchical democracy as manifested in western capitals is seen as less and less representative by the people it is supposed to answer to perhaps they should try turkish style democracy or maybe even follow the iranian or saudi systems it s ironic that ross s only interest here is to make facile criticisms of western democracy when what has collapsed in and around rojava is decidedly non western authoritarianism it would be interesting not to see what better models of governance ross has uncovered around the world other than the supposedly failed western model of democracy but unless privileged middle class westerners are bashing the west it s hard for them to show us how cool they are the other nonsense in this article is the hailing of terrorist murderer abdullah ocalan as some kind of great political thinker but what would you expect from someone who believes that the only form of punishment or social control of murderers needed is for the murderer to say he s sorry be briefly imprisoned and then have his family cook a meal for his victim s family there might be more value to ross s coverage of rojava if instead of bashing western democracy he contemplated how unique rojava was in its actual context of the middle east the political systems it should be judged against are not western ones but those of its own region i m sure rikers island is more socially peaceful than what goes on in prisons in turkey syria or iran by the way murray bookchin was a westerner excellent choice and a boost for the transition of north african countries to true democracy why does the media continue to bleat the line about merkel francis or kerry nominations closed on 1 february this was easy for me to find out on the nobel website so journalists should readily know this fact the actions these individuals were speculated about being nominated for occurred well after 1 february in any case nominations are kept secret for 50 years so not only would merkel francis and kerry not have been nominated for this year even if they are nominated for next year we won t know about it for another 50 years defenceoftherealm why would the need drone strikes in the uk when they can just arrest them i suspect that a corbyn win would have less impact on uk policy than on corbyn s own policy stance his sillier views may appeal to the narrow demographic of all those newly registered labour supporters but they ll have very little appeal across the country at large he ll be more exposed he ll have to come up with credible suggestions he ll find his statements will be dissected exposed torn to pieces my suspicion is that corbyn will find himself having to tone down his leftism rather than him shifting the national debate to the left duvinrouge how is labour dropping even further in the polls under a corbyn leadership going to end so called neo liberalism ealing no one is suggesting bombing assad although russia is helping assad to bomb that you have no problem with the suggestion is to strike islamic militants in syria the way mr khazzani was able to move easily between spain france belgium germany and austria will probably renew questions about whether the area s cherished schengen system of open borders needs reviewing in the face of increased terrorist attack threats no it won t please stop with the lazy ignorant condescending journalese only british media makes such claims and britain knows nothing about schengen in any case his movements are irrelevant it s the fact that authorities knew he was a convicted criminal with jihadist connections but didn t keep their eye on him and he could even move residence from one country to another which is nothing to do with schengen greenjay he s the one calling for calm because he s the one attacked and singled out by prescott bigkato astonishing but actually more plausible than the risible notion that jeremy corbyn could ever become pm cambridge don but they won t because the tories who want to leave the eu are a small minority and cameron shouldn t have paid this much attention to them ian watts what you mean in the same way that all the new labour party members think they are an authentic voice from the people ian watts what a surprise jeremy corbyn supporters are actually communists communist parties are among the world s most deluded fantasising that they are the authentic voice of the people when the people couldn t give two hoots about them or their silly ideas anyfulekno infiltrators what matters is the support among the electorate as a whole with corbyn as leader labour s support will sink even further perhaps not immediately but definitely over time mhloutsidebeltway i doubt the average american would be able to do much did you notice that the two guys who took the gunman down are trained military ok there was their third friend who isn t military but i doubt if he wasn t with them he could have done much njegos mhloutsidebeltway njegos and mhloutsidebeltway two sides of the same coin sapien you mean trained military if it had been the other way around a crazed gunman there are plenty of them in the us threatening everyone on an american train far fewer of those in the us and trained french military on board i m sure the american civilians wouldn t have been able to do much but the french soldiers would when exactly was the last time that americans went to the rescue of the french something more recent than 70 years ago please judyw what a surprise judyw is a putin fan funny that kellyanne has called hillary out for rightly calling some of trump s supporters deplorable when she said in february that some of them are downright nasty http www dailykos com story 2016 09 10 1568719 trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway called his supporters downright nasty skeeze robert clive british diplomats ought to be chatting up the eastern europeans and other smaller players and finding out what they want eastern europeans want freedom of movement and the right for their citizens to live and work in the uk and the rest of the eu other than that they have no particular interest in siding with the uk in any negotiations we are tired of obama s empty speeches this this has caused the world to have no respect for america s word nor does it fear our might says general michael flynn someone ought to point out to general flynn that if trump wins the us will become a laughing stock around the world and no one will respect it let alone fear it flynn himself will also be the butt of many jokes but i guess since we re on the issue of the politicisation of the military he s holding out for the position of secretary for defence so his own advancement matters more to him than the state of his country maljoffre you don t get that in russia do you presumably you disapprove of what trump s saying then even though you want him to be the us president titan12 i guess they loved how things were under george w scourge of the economists according to you then neither does nato work all judicial watch s expos s have shown is that there is no evidence of corruption by hillary clinton not that i think much of paul krugman s economic views but his article about how the media blindly repeats unverified claims of corruption about hillary in an effort to be seen to as non partisan was spot on and this article is a perfect example of it particularly in the amount of space it gives to the words and face of tom fitton which little effort is made to check surely there must be a ton of stuff on donald trump that tom fitton tireless campaigner for the truth could be digging up http www nytimes com 2016 09 05 opinion hillary clinton gets gored html beenthere why is pointing out that there are complex issues painful dilemmas and difficult decisions to be made destructive ignorant and non constructive if brexit were all so easy we d already know exactly what the government s plan is david davis would have laid it all out in parliament and article 50 would be triggered before the end of the year it s good that she s confronting the tabloid strategy of quoting some other publication so they can make false claims while trying to avoid any libel charges by saying we never alleged this we were just quoting someone else but is she suing the slovenian publication and why isn t she suing all the publications that claimed she may have abused her us visa since she also denied those allegations fiatsceptic dear fiat since you dislike the ft so much why do you read it especially since it has quite a pricey subscription warmist funny one ancient_demographer yet for some reason we keep being told that the reason places like sunderland voted to leave the eu is because they re in decline charles simmonds sorry charles but to say that suggests you know nothing about springsteen s music beyond a few hits that you ve misremembered susanmary the word means popular or egalitarian no it doesn t it means pandering to the lowest common denominator using prejudices grievances and conspiracy theories to whip up the rabble daedalus i think the question is why did anyone actually vote for this twit urania c otherwise half of their supporters will not only vote for a democrat they will vote for hillary how ironic this is the most delicious part of it all thanks for reading neil munshi what is the point of this are ft journalists going to put this at the end of all their pieces now rhj really are we meant to believe that you really have a friend in the us who knows someone on her campaign trump has serious mental health issues you re also suffering from trollitis stephen swanson every 3rd sentence out of trump s mouth is a lie how s that video of the iran cash doing the muslims in new jersey cheering 9 11 it s interesting that emma jacobs opens this review with a reference to susan faludi since faludi has recently written a book about her own father who transitioned into a transwoman in which she raises questions about many trans claims just the very fact that faludi s father could never have been her mother exposes the shaky foundations of much trans theory christopher c just wait till nov 9 i blame the internet specifically asocial media it allows the crazies to whip each other s hysteria up even more and the echo chamber effect makes them think that their views are what everyone thinks so since their views aren t the dominant ones in society because they are really not shared by the majority then things must be rigged this just whips them up even more the internet also enables them to organise better also it normalises bigoted and obnoxious behaviour making it seem ok to be abusive and use foul language and allow any old nonsense to be published however false it might be trump s success in becoming the republican nominee is and i think this is often overlooked because the other candidates were complete rubbish similarly with corbyn who has no hope in hell of being elected british prime minister or his party winning the election thus making him british prime minister i also think there is laziness in the media all too desperate to get those much needed clicks and even commentators who throw out le pen s name all the time the likelihood that le pen will win the french presidency is very low her name keeps popping up because of the french presidential system where it is well known that she is going to be a candidate whilst it s not really known who the other candidates will be also hollande is a very weak candidate so if he is the socialist candidate it s possible she will go through to the second round but it s unlikely she ll win the final vote just as happened when her father got through to the second round in the 2002 elections to remind us also that these right wing populists are not a new thing let s also not forget that there are quite complex challenges at present growth war terrorism lack of a stable international system which mean that mainstream politicians have a lot to grapple with and this gave space for the simplistic fringe idiots to raise their voices and give easy soothing answers to a jittery populace inversnaid berlusconi was an improvement on the previous system in one way in that he actually managed to form governments that lasted for a full term prior to that italy had something like 60 governments in 50 years pis deserve being popped maljoffre ok so today s politics mirror the period from 1948 1989 coase theorem brexit is because the british have not quite understood that we are no longer top dog and we no longer rule the waves just like it took several decades to acknowledge that england are not the football masters of the world so a couple of decades outside the eu will allow the english to get a good understanding of how the world really is today and that english on its own is really very very small in the scheme of things vox possibly if you voted leave armchair economist the true brexiters don t want anything like what s implied in the guardian observer article just have a look at their outrage in the daily mail comments http www dailymail co uk news article 3705524 finally eu offers deal immigration plan offer britain seven year emergency brake uk access europe s single market htmlpolitics must be very young mr pigeon lots of eu nationals live and pay taxes in the uk they ve had their rights taken away from them by this vote klrj as onomasticator points out the problem with the star is not that it can be seen as an anti semitic symbol on top of a pile of cash it s the source a white supremacist site there it was most certainly being used as a hate symbol against jews and one has to ask why the trump campaign is using that site as a resource then there s trump s reaction which is to go ballistic a credible candidate for president would simply dismiss the whole thing after making sure his campaign never clicks on the white supremacist site again and the issue would be over trump s hysteria suggests an overblown ego who has been surrounded by people who have only said yes sir to him since the moment he was born politics is a tough game it makes you wonder how dangerous his reactions would be against foreign critics of us policy if he were president hillary can t come soon enough also the british hilary too benn i kind of remember that spice girls interview from all those years ago the impression i had then was that they were trying to be whacky there was a lot of exaggeration in the interview and posh was definitely being ironic or sarcastic or something while i have no doubt that she didn t support adopting the euro at the time the whole interview was deliberately silly for example the passport comment the euro bureaucrats are destroying every bit of national identity and individuality those new passports are revolting an insult to our kingdom our independence we must keep our national individuality here s ginger from the same interview as for the royals they re the best soap opera in the world but also if you look at our british constitution as a big football match they re like the most objective referees and we spice girls are true thatcherites thatcher was the first spice girl the pioneer of our ideology girl power http archive spectator co uk article 14th december 1996 14 spice girls back sceptics on europe asdf is washington dc a state do you have any idea of the make up of the washington dc population the news is that dc just voted and the last primary is over would you prefer them not to report on it in five countries mauritania yemen saudi arabia iran and sudan simply being gay is punishable by death iran is really progressive on trans issues however if you re gay for example you can just agree to sex reassignment surgery which will correct your homosexuality this is after all also the logical conclusion of many trans activists in western countries whereby any young teen who may be gay and thus non gender conforming could just be diagnosed as having gender dysphoria and be put on puberty blockers to stop them from developing into their biological sex this will make sure that people of the same sex don t form relationships bajanboy hilarious so she gets 3 million more votes than him yet he s supposedly the better candidate at least the berniebros have given up on their feeble line that the democratic primaries weren t democratic enough since even they realise that hillary has won the vote now they want to swing the superdelegates his way despite previously claiming that was a corrupt system christopher c bonkers she hasn t struggled at all she s been the clear winner for a while perhaps after 7 june even you and your fellow hillary haters will admit that hillary isn t losing to bernie in fact she s already beaten him the question therefore is why isn t he getting his supporters to rally behind her although truth be told courtney s about a week out date and bernie s already started his gradual retreat albeit at a very slow pace what you re suggesting is that the democratic nomination should be decided not on the actual votes cast in the official democratic primaries to select that party s candidate but on opinion polls for an election in 6 months time so even though hillary has overwhelmingly won in terms of votes cast all those voters should be ignored and sanders is the one claiming the process is undemocratic bear in mind very little vetting of sanders has been done the one interview he did where he was forced to outline his proposals in detail was laughable trump would tear crazy bernie apart the only reason he s left him alone so far is to try and cause hillary problems hofer will find himself having to compromise and be flexible like all the extremists do in the end alfred nassim what do you think of trump s position just the other week according to which south korea and japan should just arm themselves with nuclear weapons to defend themselves against any nuclear weapons north korea might have he tends not to care about those issues they re not even on his radar and pope francis is not a friend antoine123 indeed one wonders why this article makes no mention of john miller seeing as it s supposedly giving a roundup of trump s playboy image in the media over the past few days but mrs clinton has also had to walk a fine path she has been relatively subdued in attacking mr trump over his stance on women compared with her attacks on him over other issues because of concerns that he will respond by raising questions about her relationship with bill clinton the former president and his extramarital sexual dalliances you really think this is the reason everyone in the world knows about bill clinton s extramarital sexual dalliances it s not as though donald trump has anything new to tell us and public opinion has only sympathised with her on that issue perhaps the real reason she s not attacking trump on women is because she d prefer to stick to policies not personalities and trump is his own worst enemy when it comes to women so bernie sanders is a supporter of the big polluting coal industry at least hillary is prepared to take political risks in order to argue in favour of what she believes is the right policy trump and sanders just say whatever they think they re going to get most votes for if they were ever elected as president they would just make a mess of things bernie sanders is calling for democratic superdelegates the party elite who cast votes at the democratic national convention and overwhelmingly favour mrs clinton to switch sides and support him instead what a hypocrite he bangs on about how skewed the system is and that s it s all a backroom deal among the elite yet then he wants that same elite to ignore the fact that clinton has got 3 million more votes than he has and to back him instead so that he can get the nomination one wonders how much better sanders would poll against trump if his views and vague policy announcements were actually scrutinised the one time he did an interview to flesh out his proposals he made an utter fool of himself harold godwinson budweis was the german name for the town yes because it was the german population of bohemia that created its beer industry after wwii almost all germans were expelled let_them_eat_cake if donald trump winning the republican nomination is democracy then hillary clinton who has so far racked up around more than 2 million votes than trump got must represent according to your argument the purest form of democracy the real democratic result will come with the presidential election result if clinton wins will you hail that result as democracy christopher c it s fun how you ve gone all french now that even you ve realised the brit act won t work i think he ll huff and puff and stamp his little feet and his adoring followers will cry and pout and get hysterical if you think an england hari_seldon well trump wants to tear up all the us s trade agreements and force through new ones that are totally skewed in favour of the us if you an england outside of the eu and is going to be a priority for trump or that he s going to give england a good deal then i wish you all the best hari_seldon trump can try and pivot to the centre all he likes but we will still remember what he said about muslims and mexicans and waterboarding and lyin ted and bizarre allegations against rafael cruz some also remember that he was a big birther besides when he tries to pivot to the centre and sound presidential and moderate he is forced to read prepared speeches a printout of teleprompter and what he says tends to be so vacuous and superficial it s easy to pick holes in it perhaps john redwood would have been more honest if he d omitted the disingenuous anti eu barbs and focused on what a president trump s proposals would mean for a britain outside the eu trump thinks nato is obsolete undermining a main argument of brexiters one put forward by john redwood himself is that membership of the eu is irrelevant to britain s global status as it is nato membership that is important then there s trump s call to rewrite the us s trade agreements to skew much more favourably to the us with increased tariffs and a market that is tighter to get into brexiters wishful thinking that britain will get a great trade deal with the us outside of the eu seems even more of a fantasy with the prospect of a president trump let s also not forget that the people brexiters truly want to keep out with their campaign to leave the eu are people just like trump s wives czechs slovenians and other eastern europeans hillary clinton has made it clear that she believes britain is stronger in the eu and the us needs as its partner a strong eu which has britain in it in passing oh please redwood himself made the completely irrelevant comment understanding mr trump has been made much more difficult for europeans by the visceral dislike of him and his rhetoric that some expressed in his early phase many found his idea of a large and long fence to keep mexicans out of the us unpleasant though ironically troubles with the eu s more liberal policies soon led to the construction of such fences in central europe with the continuation of high fences at the calais uk french border which has no impact on investors yet he just stuck it in to make a silly anti eu jibe while ignoring what might be truly disastrous for investors in the uk europe us and the whole world a potential uk exit from the eu and also ignoring the more direct result for a britain outside the eu in terms of a new or any us president paul browne saying i believe britain may leave the eu isn t the same thing as saying i believe britain should leave the eu in any case good luck trying to ally post brexit with a trump or cruz administration you know what donald trump says about the us s trade agreements he wants to tear them all up and impose heavy tariffs cruz is clearly just trying to find a point to bash obama on just on intervening cruz doesn t believe that the uk what he calls england should leave the eu more to the point only someone like sebastian payne would even try to imply that there is even the hint of suggestion even if he then dumps the idea that any us presidential candidate would ever think that it s best for the uk to leave the eu at least he points out that the only foreign support the brexiters get is from people like marine le pen incrementalist the lack of in depth coverage of sanders positions in the media is due to the fact that he himself has rarely given an in depth outline of them when he did finally attempt to spell out some of his plans as in the case of the banks he revealed just how shallow and unworkable they are mariannanyc whenever the swiss direct democracy argument is put forward i m always reminded of how women in switzerland only got the vote in the 1970s because male voters continued to vote in referenda against giving women the right to vote in some swiss regions it wasn t until the early 1990s that men voted in a referendum to allow women to vote the invisible hand i can assure you europe will get on fine with hillary trump we ll just have to hold our noses and prepare for the worst at least he will be limited in what he can do given that he won t have any allies quietly waiting most of what trump is spouting is not in the interest of much of the world outside the us if he wants us to sign treaties with him he is the one who is going to have to do the most compromising especially considering he swings from extreme position to another often contradictory mostly incoherent when if faced with the cold reality of responsibility and real life scary situations he will have to change his tune otherwise it will indeed be a mess for the usa fiatsceptic so unless the ft publishes your personal opinions as its editorial and news line it s biased kevin alexanderman but trump is racist he calls for judging people on the basis of their race or background as opposed to their value as an individual judyw whoever is president will be stuck with wiping out isis but without boots on the ground so you don t agree with trump s latest position to send 20 000 to 30 000 troops to the middle east to fight isis violet pimpernel have tens of millions voted for trump he hasn t been elected to anything yet in fact he s never stood for political position never been elected never had to exercise political power and responsibility on a day today basis if things carry on as they have so far one suspects that it s highly unlikely he ll be elected as president of the usa but i guess you agree that the tens of millions who voted twice for barack obama to be president were right then judyw hillary indeed may be the foreign policy exception because she was secretary of state and it s widely acknowledged among objective commentators i e not tin hats that she did a pretty good job of it benghazi is a made up thing by the tin hatters the emails she should have thought about a bit more but the truth is at the time everything she did was legally ok there is a whole lot more that s dodgy about trump and his whole economic policy which he thinks will make america great again but will actually destroy it is actually attached to foreign policy and foreign relations his only tool is to slap tariffs on imports that will damage all the us s relationships with countries around the world paul browne the biggest pusher of turkey s membership of the eu is britain all 28 eu countries supported the deal with turkey it s impossible to do anything about controlling migration and refugees without dealing with turkey considering they come through turkey greece and italy are in total agreement with germany on refugees southern and eastern states want to be in the eu and don t think it s failing them when southern states have complaints their solution is more europe eastern states want their citizens to be able to settle in britain anti refugee orban is the one who cited the turkish dictator as his role model brummie hey brummie do you think the ft sent gideon all the way out to new york just to interview guttenberg this man is of course lying when he claims he s not interested in a return to german politics and a shot at the chancellorship this whole interview is designed for that purpose we still haven t seen out of sheer luck sometimes a charlie hebdo style terrorist attack in germany that s because the charlie hebdo attackers weren t immigrants but born and bred frenchmen as any terrorism experts will tell you the likelihood of terrorists coming in with the refugee flows is very small what germany has had in recent times is neo nazis shooting dead turks and a few greeks but the police not investigating these murders properly because they thought that they were the result of the funny ethnics having feuds with each other gideon rachman also doesn t know what he s talking about that s par for the course whenever he talks about european politics however love peace love china are you claiming that trump should be off bounds to any criticism p s one person who doesn t love is trump betterway not a female lawyer wow she must be awful tollemache trump hasn t done any politics he s done campaigning tactics with the advantage of a pretty bad set of republican candidates he s never run a government never done a budget never had to negotiate a political deal never had to hold a dialogue with allies and rivals he s also never won an election and been held to account by the voters william thayer sr ms benz didn t talk about illegal migration she simply expressed her dislike of people who look and sound a bit different from her living in the us since she doesn t like people from south america so much perhaps she should campaign against the brazilian owned meat

most parisians aren t employed by one of the world s leading newspapers solely to write weekly articles with their personal views and hence only need a laptop and internet connection to do their work

things up or help things improve for the whole world so yes it is legitimate for people in britain germany iran and elsewhere to have an opinion from what we ve heard about trump s views on foreign affairs he sounds like he d be create a big mess for the rest of us in an case phil the american asked shrimsley what has opinion of trump was robbie2 trump is the child of migrants married to migrants who hates migrants newyorker2014 no way is newyorker2014 black or asian newyorker2014 claims to be an american have you ever read any of his previous comments md8058 trump was basically handed his property business by his second generation immigrant father he s not a self made man and didn t start build and achieve success in property himself ealing he s not any more of an awful prospect than the idea of jeremy corbyn as british prime minister which is a horrific but thankfully highly improbably prospect judyw the pope s opinion is far more relevant than your opinion on eu affairs dave pollard a perfect example of what shrimsley describes as being on twitter and telling anyone who disagrees with you that they are tory scum and the new politics is never wrong in 2020 you will find out hilarious enjoy chewing on your hat what could be better than a well planned place where everything works flawlessly due to a teutonic eye for detail but is also latin enough to make it feel a million miles from village life in baden w rttemberg but they re not particularly latin sorry but the reason they re so pleasant is because they feel like southern austria tuscany is wonderful but it doesn t quite have that same ease of living maljoffre not as close a resemblance as varoufakis and voldemort far easier to remove greece from the schengen zone then this article completely ignores what putin s own aims and vision are i e a eurasian union which would have had ukraine as its crown jewel now with his actions he has lost ukraine which wants closer ties with the eu this dispute isn t about crimea that s just mr putin s little diversion tactic to show he s still tough it s about ukraine and putin s attempt to recreate a russian empire through a eurasian union now the eurasian union will just be asian aside from the kleptocracy of belarus yet even the central asian countries that considered being part of the eurasian union are becoming more wary of putin s russia now hansandfrans clinton being blocked from initiating gun control laws alex yet the other member states have to accept the uk threatening to put a bomb under the eu annie leibovitz has interesting compositions but with the advent of digital she sure over photoshops her pics and saturates them in non natural colour despite her attempt at depth with some weird kind of 3d effect the figures in her latest pic of the queen look flat and have the complexion of waxworks paul browne and have you heard what trump and sanders say about trade deals they would hammer england tsotsi the tata plant is being closed because the steel produced there doesn t represent any kind of particular quality and is not a niche product it s a mass product of a kind that the world has a glut of the tata case is a good illustration of exactly how difficult it will be for an england outside of the eu to negotiate favourable trade deals if as a single country there will be much interest around the world in a trade deal with it outside of the eu so england all on its own will try to get a trade deal with china in which it will demand that tariffs of 40 be slapped on chinese steel exports or indian companies such as tata will have to offer excellent working and redundancy terms to british workers imagine trying to negotiate a trade deal with the us although the us has explicitly said that it is not interested in trade deals with single countries under a president trump or a president sanders but what do facts and reality matter to brexiters who live in a fantasy world in which everything is blamed on the eu which in their eyes can do no good everything british is wonderful and the whole world is just crying out for british goods but the nasty eu is preventing britain from manufacturing and exporting even though every other country in the eu manages this yeah right mad_is_dead that s over half a century ago don t you think we should try and move on or do you believe we should be forever enemies i wonder what tusk will say when pis charge him with negligence and even possibly for an alleged cover up over what happened at smolensk dave pollard any opinion on taiwan and its relations with china or do you only ever focus on the us as though there are no other countries in the world now what what military with a machete now what everyone is signing that agreement with iran uk france russia china why should the rest of the world accept a few crazies in the us senate blocking international attempts at an agreement with iran barnard sure the fact that the americans have already received medals and been praised by top french politicians is an obvious example of omitting mention of us personnel well he should be satisfied with yesterday s agreement then sarah hancock yes you got the reasons right plus dodgy statistics it would probably be more effective and less hypocritical for the us to pay the imf the full contribution it owes and to support instead of block as it is currently doing reforms to make the imf more globally representative an incredibly easy solution would be for the us simply to hand over a few tens or even hundreds of billions of euros direct to greece with no expectation of reforms or repayment since that seems to be what mr gehman believes the us should be demanding the europeans do so far the american words have had little substantial effect the world cannot wait any longer amusing assumption that the world is hanging on the lips of the americans gehman also seems to believe that the rest of the world is demanding that the us forces the imf to completely abandon all its rules and principles while much of the recent shift is due to popular anger at ms merkel s handling of the refugee crisis which has seen the afd surge from nowhere to win up to a quarter of the vote on sunday mr kretschmann s success shows the more established greens may be the ultimate beneficiary stefan wagstyl really isn t a particularly objective reporter for a start up to a quarter of the vote on sunday dramatically overstates the afd vote more to the point where the afd did get around a quarter of the vote the cdu actually won and the vote losers were the greens and spd where the cdu vote dropped the afd got around 15 and pro refugee candidates of other parties won and even though wagstyl is obliged to note that mr kretschmann fully backed merkel s handing of the refugee policy because he s only interested in treating merkel he is unable to explain the contradiction at the heart of his spin those establishment candidates who backed the refugee policy did well those who didn t flopped if julia kl ckner and guido wolf hadn t tried to undermine merkel and had fully supported her refugee policy it s very possible that today they would be the new state governors voters don t necessarily like the disloyal who are obviously so desperate to get votes they re willing to say anything and as countless political parties in europe and even the republicans in the us are discovering if establishment candidates try to shift to the right to pander to anger the only thing they end up doing is strengthen the populist and extremist candidates and undermine their own base ric you mean the fn s efforts to abandon their policy of withdrawal from the eu anne sylvaine chassany ft it s not really a paradox fn is mainly a protest vote at a time when there is a weak president and mostly backward looking socialist party with the centre right struggling to modernise and unite around a credible leader attracting the largest share of votes doesn t matter that much perhaps 30 vote for the fn but the 70 who vote against them is an overwhelmingly larger group the french don t want to leave the eu and the fn know that which is precisely the point of this call for a renegotiation and referendum the fn policy has always been withdrawal from the eu by demanding a renegotiation they can abandon the policy of withdrawal and remain in the eu while claiming to have won concessions ctl except the uk referendum won t bring the eu down and most french want to remain in the eu be a leading force in the eu and have the euro as their currency whitelake i think the people of the world should have a say on for example whether the uk should be a permanent member of the un security zone why not considering how undemocratic that privileged position is on a global level klirhed erm it s the uk that s leading the effort to stop the eu from taking a tougher line with china and which up until a few months ago was the biggest supporter of turkish membership in the eu and the part of europe where most dodgy russian money ends up in the unlikely event that trump gets into the white house he will not know what s hit him patuk so you re suggesting that the countries around russia that have chosen to join nato should not be permitted to make the choice to join and that russia should decide what their alliances are for them francheska maya smith johnson so in your opinion montenegro should not be permitted to decide which alliances it joins instead russia should decide for it what alexander temerko seems not to realise is that boris johnson doesn t want a strong eu he wants a weak one and he doesn t want britain in it and not for reasons relating at all to foreign policy in fact boris is an admirer of putin and a critic of the ukrainians his attack on eu involvement in ukraine isn t because he believes the eu has been too timid there but because he does not believe the eu should be involved at all boris also toes the putin line on syria a stronger eu able to handle foreign policy challenges would require an eu that is far more integrated there is something very bonkers about this article this dariga nazarbayeva deputy prime minister and daughter of the country s president in february said that kazakh children should learn chinese in addition to kazakh russian and english is not actually what is said at the link apparently what the deputy prime daughter said was everyone should know perfectly at least three languages kazakh state language russian and english and that in the near future we all need to know chinese language this is not the same as claiming that she said kazakh children should learn chinese as well as kazakh russian and english https primeminister kz news show 22 dnazarbaeva otmetila neobhodimost izuchenija anglijskogo i kitajskogo jazykov 05 02 2016 lang en zhuubaajie kazakhs and chinese don t look dramatically different gmc kathrin hille knows russia quite well however and her article is much more insightful than anything ursus ursa has ever said julianep that concert is all you need to prove that he is a crony of putin who gave him the mariinsky as his own toy to play with and that putin does indeed have influence over assad he just doesn t use it in the right direction llaingoch but it s these overseas leaders that you need to get all these wonderful trade deals that brexiters imagine are going to happen just like that if they re telling you nope there ain t going to be no such trade deal in fact there will be less interest in your country all together then that isn t something that should be ignored tagliatellor there s a huge difference between not being part of the eurozone and not being in the eu not being in the eu means the benefits britain offers as part of the single market and as a base to trade with the rest of europe just are no longer there for foreign companies and it s only because britain is in the eu that sterling is a serious currency outside of the eu sterling would suffer hugely the irony being that it s only because britain is in the eu that the impact of its not being in the eurozone is muted because eu membership is what boosts sterling murtibing every single point you made is bonkers i find harvey s music incredibly superficial in the literal sense that it s all a posy artificial exterior that strives to sound cool and intellectual and meaningful but it has no emotional content and just doesn t work for me at least as music syrians are indeed tired of war after five long years a war that was only extended for so long by russia and iran s military support for bashar al assad s regime which would have collapsed a long time ago one senior european intelligence official told the ft that russia s original plan had been to spearhead a swift military campaign that would within months take the forces of president bashar al assad up to the turkish border hence russia s deliberate buzzing of turkey s airspace and turkey s downing of russia s planes that didn t quite work out for putin and another thing to bear in mind is that russia s apparent withdrawal is a message to assad that russia will only back him up to a point assad s insistence on forever remaining president is blocking the negotiations this is russia s way of telling him not to push it too much after saving his skin they realise that it s impossible to get rid of him so the whole of eu policy should be frozen for one small country that should have resolved its problem with turkey before joining but declined to do so because it wanted to get the eu involved even though the eu kept saying the cyprus problem was nothing to do with it the negotiations over the cyprus problem have nothing to do with anastasiades objections if there were no negotiations right now anastasiades would complain that the chapters need to be frozen so as to put pressure on the turks to return to the negotiating table turkey s chapters should be opened or frozen solely on the basis of how turkey is implementing their criteria not as a tool on cyprus s part to resolve in its separate dispute with turkey you forget to mention that the biggest supporter of this deal with turkey is greece even more interesting would be a rupture between greece and cyprus in any case some formula will be found opening an airport or ports in reality anastasiades is willing to take a slightly different line from previous presidents of cyprus with the exception of clerides in fact something like that could actually give a push to find a settlement and start getting the greeks and turks of cyprus working together oh another interesting point anastasiades just the other week sent a request to the eu to make turkey an official language rosalba typing error i meant turkish https euobserver com institutional 132476 daedalus all putin has demonstrated to europe with his syria escapade is how untrustworthy and immoral he is only confirming the impression he gave with his attack on ukraine riskstrategies since the ft is subscription based one wonders why you are reading it it s obviously by choice and commitment so if you don t like what the neocon editors of the ft in your words are doing just don t subscribe and don t read shokai what putin wanted in ukraine was to make ukraine join his eurasian economic union and not sign a trade agreement with the eu he failed on both those counts philip owen not just the 90s baby slump but also the loss of all those uzbeki etc former migrant workers who are being increasingly put off russia and its sinking rouble dean armond it s also the fact that she s honest and broke the story publicly herself if there were simply rumours accusations denials nike would have stood firmly behind her as it does with the deliberate yet denying dopers it sponsors gideon rachman is incapable of offering any positive suggestions all he does is try to make everything sound scary and dark he presents every option as bad yet is unable to put forward anything that in his opinion would be a viable option philip seaton one of the primary justifications voiced by the eu for the infusion of hundreds of billions of euro s into a failed greece was that if greece left the eu it would become a funnel for terrorists and refugees from the mid east wars into the eu really where did you read this and where was the possibility of greece leaving the eu ever discussed musso well sinn does talk rubbish most of the time maljoffre so funny maljoffre you do realise that kaczynski accuses putin of having deliberately killed his brother in that accident i doubt very much that he considers putin his brother maljoffre hi maljoffre did you see my point about how never in a million years would kaczynski consider putin as his brother considering he accuses him of murdering his actual brother kaczynski is also fully behind ukraine and wants nato to get tough your neo authoritarian fantasy just won t work out in this case p s goodnight you wrote that at around 2 30 pm cet are you in australia miklos they were voted in by 37 of the electorate who voted that hardly represents the vast majority of polish citizens harry lime mr orban does not want hungary to leave schengen none of the v4 countries do olaf von rein but the irony is hungary was actually due to be exempted from the quota system precisely because it was on the refugee route and was to be relieved of the numbers that had gathered there who would be distributed to other countries but because orban wanted to kill off any suggestion that muslims would be able to settle ever in hungary he is now opposing the quota plan i think he actually voted for it at the summit however and so hungary was removed from the list of countries to be exempt olaf von rein it s not about being overrun it s about offering asylum it should be noted that mr orban has blocked referendums on issues such as the adoption of hungary s new constitution introduced by his government and whether shops should be allowed to open on sundays for which there was a popular petition so parliament should have debated it but orban blocked it musso but the irony is that mr orban demands that britain should accept all eastern europeans who wish to settle there and he also believes they should be entitled to benefits in the same way as long term residents of the country ignoring the fact that this is apparently one of the most crucial aspects of why the uk is having a referendum on eu membership tiresias isn t it ironic how mr orban was one of the most vociferous opponents on any migration or benefit restrictions of eu citizens to the uk indeed the british should tell mr orban where to go having a referendum to introduce caps on eastern europeans settling in the uk habakuk good but are you an eastern european because it was the eastern europeans orban in particular who were outraged at the suggestion that eu migration and benefit receipt to the uk be capped habakuk danish makes sense i thought you had an opt out from the quota thing anyway as an opt out nation yes the danes like referenda on eu issues i notice that in the last referendum you voted to leave europol despite being the eu member state that most uses it i am a briton resident for many years however on the so called refugee route i m not sure there is such a lack of popular support for the quota system as you claim perhaps among certain groups on the internet but a recent opinion poll shows that the majority of europeans believe refugees should be helped and that the burden should be shared among all eu countries if hungary doesn t want to take any then they should have their eu funds cut https www bertelsmann stiftung de en topics aktuelle meldungen 2016 februar majority of the eu citizens wants a fair distribution of refugees i think a much much bigger issue of our time is the destruction of syria and the displacement of millions of its people whose homes have been bombed to smithereens when they re not being slaughtered by isis habakuk indeed the british need to be given a vote on whether to impose caps on eastern europeans such as hungarians residing in the uk oblio although recession battered ukraine s exports have fallen sharply this year the proportion going to the eu has jumped from below 25 per cent in 2012 to almost 35 per cent in the first seven months of this year why is there this constant spin on articles about putin or russia about russia is back as a world power or whatever we know russia is a military power we know it s a big country we know it s a permanent member of the un security council with nuclear weapons so what global influence isn t just measured in terms of weapons fired however but in terms of the economy culture innovation how many globally recognised russian companies are there how many big russian films or pop stars are there is moscow becoming a great global capital are millions around the world learning russian russia can be great in more than just weaponry if it opens up socially culturally and economically becomes outward looking and dynamic if all it does is have a chip on its shoulder and snap at the west all the time it s not going to get much further than bombing some sites making a few vetoes at the un and inspiring the anti western trolls of cyberspace caloundra the point about admitting is that most russian commentary had previously tried to deny play down or deride suggestions that the plane was brought down by a bomb putin s biggest fans on these very comments threads were also vociferously challenging that view auskap when you were spending a month in russia and having your views changed did you read the russian media the one in russian not the english language stuff they put out which is bad enough because the views expressed there about the west europe the us are positively bizarre p s we know ordinary russian people are perfectly fine and just like ordinary people everywhere greaterfool sure russia s plan seems to be turning out really well just a small point the goal of assad s forces isn t to eliminate isis but to eliminate any opposition to the rule of the assad dynasty but even that seems to be backfiring on them the west isn t allowed to have any kind of military plan for wiping out isis russia and its trolls immediately lash out at anything resembling possible military action by the west the only solution is a political one that gets the opposing sides effectively iran and saudi arabia on board to permit a political transition to a more pluralistic system in syria i won t say democracy since russia and its trolls always lash out at that too which will then be followed up by a broad military alliance to wipe out the vipers that are isis coupled with efforts to cut of the financial intelligence military and moral support supplied to them unfortunately syria is at the mercy of power games originating outside of its borders iran saudi arabia us russia hopefully something will start happening at the next vienna meeting although there is a long way to do christopher c hi christopher have you decided which line to follow yet western countries which believe that flight 9268 was brought down by an isis bomb or putin who denies that erik11235813 is isis the name they actually give themselves they kill other muslims who don t believe in their particular dogma of islam they are in conflict with al qaeda certain states in the region share the goals of isis because this will further the power of those states so their political leaders believe it s about politics and control of the middle east more than about religion bengidog or type correctly stringbean the only other explanation that would make sense to me is if it was an isis bomb but ended up on the wrong plane and they are now keeping quiet about it because they don t want to antagonise the russians who up till now have pretty much left them alone you re right that the russians have pretty much left isis alone up till now but that s about the only thing in your post that s right why pick a russian plane and not a western one i suspect through the eyes of a murderous violent jihadist all foreigners are the same they don t necessarily see geopolitics in the same way as you do russia has come out militarily in support of assad it s operating alongside iran isis oppose assad and iran hence russians are targets bertyshalom why would labelling products made in the settlements create unemployment for palestinians are you suggesting that products from the settlements are so unattractive european consumers would choose not to buy them francheska maya smith johnson thanks mr putin we appreciate your help in bombing those who are fighting isis judyw the moldovans can vote for whoever they want and there is no eu influence involved by saying west here you are trying to imply that the us is trying to install a government of its own liking in any case henry foy is one of the ft s worst journalists along with wagstly and spiegel muenchau is the worst opinion writer this is indeed a fairly pathetic article not reflecting on the issues at hand i e the charges against the government and what the population thinks but going for the scandal angle of some kind of supposed conflict between the eu and russia christopher c christopher c thinks life is a video game twitchy meatbag it means iranian generals euphemistically referred to as military advisers have been present on the ground in syria to check out the situation for the russians before the russians launch their air raids this is probably to confirm where the anti assad forces are before the russians fire at them twitchy meatbag a top iranian military commander has been killed by isis in syria where he was advising the syrian army in its fight against extremists iranian state media reported friday brig gen hossein hamedani a former commander in the iran iraq war of 1980 88 was killed thursday night outside aleppo during an attack by isis iran s semiofficial fars news agency reported http edition cnn com 2015 10 09 world syria isis eastern european how about refugees illegal migrants should definitely be blocked but people freeing from bombings and isis and a country that has basically been torn to smithereens are people in need of assistance and labelling them as illegal is pretty vile and yes there is huge hypocrisy on the part of poles and other eastern europeans who demand the right to settle anywhere in the eu and criticise british attempts to change that but who then do everything they can not to have someone with slightly brown skin settle in their country even if that person has escaped from death and destruction also if you believe in the cohesion of the eu then you need to help support that cohesion and the taking of difficult decisions at an eu level instead of screaming and wailing that your own short term narrow minded interests are not being met is poland in the eu just for what it can get out of it with no interest in helping support or build up the eu as a whole and don t forget your declining birth rates and ageing populations jaroslaw kaczynski the veteran pis leader addressing party officials who chanted his name in a rallying cry that will reverberate across the eu what histrionic nonsense pis have a daft economic agenda these aren t the boom times anymore as they were last time they were in power they ll end up backtracking on much of what they ve promised and create an unfavourable economic climate in any case kaczynski is not the prime minister and would probably never be elected as prime minister which is why he wasn t the candidate poland is also much more integrated into the eu than it was 8 years ago and poles are used to being europeans poland is also in a more tricky position vis a vis a more belligerent russia and will need europe rather than the pis agenda being so popular perhaps voters were tired of the previous government ric hilarious sameasow one suspects that former members of the soviet union and countries that were once in russia s sphere and were lucky to escape see russia as the great colonial simpering from having lost its former imperial reach raging to get it back in some way or other too bad the russian elite forgets if it was ever aware that the best way to influence is through an open economy and an open society internet trolls do no signify influence by the way the soviet union lost the cold war if you want to see it as a fight ric moldova is indeed a victim of russian imperialism but you can also be a pro eu or even an eu politician and be corrupt silvio berlusconi for example is a former eu politician who is widely believed to be corrupt yet he is a best friend of the pure as snow vladimir putin in moldova s case as in ukraine decades of a soviet mindset are hard to shift by the way it was the parliament with a majority of pro eu mps which voted to lift filat s immunity wendellmurray the sudden and unwarranted collapse of the soviet system is being pursued wendellmurray dreams of the restoration of soviet order the collapse of the soviet system was not sudden nor was it unwarranted the soviet system as you call it collapsed because it was rubbish and dysfunctional and it collapsed as a result of its inherent weaknesses destructiveness and incompetence vladimir putin turned up for the gala in moscow he stood under a giant picture of tchaikovsky which was ironic given his sexual politics and stayed to the end how many politicians in the west would do that gergiev is a big associate and ally of putin it wasn t just if at all about the music he publicly supports putin and putin puts him in some nice positions the photo gives the impression that putin stood centre stage for the whole event making himself the focus of the evening charming maljoffre according to russian media there was bad weather and so russian planes didn t know where they were going even though other russian media said that the weather was great that day so they fighter pilots could see exactly where they were bombing look it up i need to go and live a life now it s funny watching putin lovers who get faux outraged at anything the us does abandoning all their fake moral principles when it comes to the bombing actions of their great hero the potential abandonment of the turkish stream project probably explains why the russian government in the form of gazprom has done a backflip and dropped all its objections to the commission s terms for delinking oil and gas prices as well as softening its stance towards gas supplies through ukraine http www ft com intl cms s 0 1232c6d4 65ec 11e5 a57f 21b88f7d973f html axzz3nnwfahtm christopher c since russia s aims are to entrench assad in power and destroy the opposition with the occasional unrisky foray against isis it depends on what if it succeeds means does success for you mean crushing the opposition and keeping the assad family in power in perpetuity along with russia s naval base christopher c p s if you define success as defeating isis although this isn t actually one of russia s aims then russia would need to send in ground troops that would be interesting christopher c i m not an isis fan either but i don t think russia s actions in syria are aimed at protecting train travellers in western europe or even train travellers in russia this is about syria where assad has slaughtered more civilians than isis has not that isis is a pleasant organisation at all which is why it s europe s moral obligation to offer refuge to those syrians fleeing from isis assad and the various international bombs falling in their country it putin truly cared about the syrian people he would also open his doors to syrian refugees i believe that some informed observers have also claimed that putin s support for assad over the past years created a vacuum among the moderate opposition which allowed isis to come in again a fact you have not been able to absorb because of your slavish love for putin russia s aim in syria is not to destroy isis for that it would have to be prepared to send in ground troops if that eventuality ever did happen it would still not be to destroy isis but to ensure that his political client assad stays in power smn what legal clearance are you talking about putin gave a speech at the un general assembly this wasn t a un vote approving of his proposals unless you re talking about the vote in the russian parliament but that was merely to rubber stamp any future possibility of russia sending ground troops into syria edoroshi he has to give his own people a bit of a morale boost before he sends young russians off to die in order to save the regime of bashar al assad it shouldn t be up to the us but nor should it be up to russia at present russia is pursuing military action in syria solely to keep bashar al assad in place luke lea it s not the west that s backing assad who as you point out doesn t have legitimacy among the majority in syria it s russia syria s majority is sunni yet they re being ruled by a shia dynasty if you want to talk in tribal clan based loyalties then assad is not supported by the majority of the syrian population who are sunni but is rejected by them seems it s russia who s supporting the one who doesn t have the support of the majority in syria trying to impose its own notion of legitimacy i e the one who is the best client of putin darius jedburg exactly who is he a hero to syrians fleeing to europe and not russia global opinion polls show that russia under putin does not have a good image at the same time putin has to frame russian military involvement in syria to his domestic audience as about russia showing how powerful it is that even the us has to bow to putin s greatness because ordinary russians are probably concerned about their country getting dragged into syria s war he also has to deflect from the fact that his military and intelligence support of his political client assad has prolonged the war in syria kick how charming of you and what about the mass of the people who identify as ukrainian not as russian or polish if ukraine had agreed to joining putin s eurasian union would you have deigned with your opinion to permit the existence of an independent ukraine to the extent that it s possible to be independent in the eurasian union maljoffre no comment on russia s very direct military involvement on syria however vanbrugh indeed regardless of the troll comments on news sites the syrian observatory of human rights is actually quite respected among experts of course for most of the putinista trolls a two bedroomed terrace is an upgrade as they tend to live in basements good question when putin pontificates about syria and how the west has supposedly caused the humanitarian crisis there he always forgets to mention just how many syrian refugees russia will be taking in despite the fact that in the same breadth he mentions military assistance to help the syrians tatiana fazio you mean the residents of crimea or people who identify as russian russia is also responsible for the situation in ukraine and also for some of what is going on in syria russia also has a seemingly endless budget when it comes to providing the assad regime with military and intelligence assistance rt and russian propaganda in general always acts shocked and astonished ealing well you are constantly regaling us with the russian narrative according to which everything that goes wrong in ukraine is the fault of the west and the ukrainians and putin is absolutely perfect as for the entire western media have you ever compared the western media with the russian media how do you think the russian media fares in terms of objectivity and partiality at least you talk in terms of the ukrainians perhaps the next step will be to acknowledge that the ukrainians do have at least a little bit of a legitimate say in what goes on in their own country ealing a there aren t any gung ho western politicians banging the battle drum against syria b do you believe that the british government should accept refugees from syria christopher c why is reporting on a current event and reactions to it the same as lashing out at russia inversnaid a on ukraine erm no you haven t quite got that right not at all b relations with russia are not really poland s main concern since russia itself has undermined them and has trouble seeing poland as an independent country that isn t part of its sphere of influence a bit like the situation with ukraine but considering jaroslav kaczynski accused russia of assassinating his brother i think it s fair to say that under tusk and sikorski poland s relations with russia improved why no stavros theodorakis why zoe konstantopoulou instead who is not even a party leader why is lafazanis shown first when his party has 8 maximum in the polls some translations leftwing veteran spent the past 40 years shouting the same slogans safe hands a zero respected widely considered a joke hermes that s only in the language of those like syriza and yourself hermes who believe that even though a greece is supposed to be a democracy anyone who dares to form a political party with positions that are different from your own must be a plant and part of a conspiracy hence why when your preferred party syriza does actually form a government it turns out to be the laughable ridiculous pathetic mess that s currently destroying the country in any case all i said was why no mention of theodorakis i even gave translations that were satirical of all the parties not just your dear lafazanis or perhaps your heart flutters for the rather disturbed zoe konstantopoulou the very fact you jump out to attack me for even mentioning theodorakis existence only goes to prove my point that anyone who even dares to mention alternative possibilities must in the view of your political ideology be crushed have mud thrown at them be made to appear to be a bad sneaky person cassandra you mean the protestors in syntagma square i m sure they d agree sure when the same slogans are repeated time and again in greece some people believe them greece is a country that believes in conspiracy theories there s always got to be something hiding behind things always got to be some evil outsider or traitorous insider plotting against the country facts and proof and things that can be measured and verified are irrelevant within this mindset in this way of doing things since everyone says bobolas put him there then bobolas must have put him there and of course for a nefarious reason no evidence or facts are required at all the italians have something similar which they call dietrologia where small people who want to show how big and clever they are in their minds imply that they know the truth of what really hides behind something that they have this great inside knowledge at least in italy they ve identified this phenomenon as a problem and given a name to it it s no different from the old peasant mentality of always being suspicious of the people in the next village it s a mentality that has held greece back and prevented it from fully modernising even tsipras is now being accused of being placed where he is by interests by the way do you still like him in any case however much you and hermes want to deny it theodorakis is more of a serious electoral challenge to tsipras than fofi gennimata or zoe konstantopoulou liondemocrats i m not a crystal ball reader and despite her name our dear friend cassandra s ability to read the future is really quite risible but so far anel and papandreou s new group are appear to be on very low percentages have you heard fofi speak what exactly is this woman doing for her party she may be a very pleasant individual but the idea that she is a respected politician is way off the mark golden dawn i don t think so they never were much of anything but the foreign non greek media just loved the narrative of the rise of extremism it s so much more exciting and sexy than trying to understand the actual situation the result seems a little unpredictable as syriza is falling apart njegos faces 15 years in prison is not the same as has been sentenced to 15 years in prison do you not see the difference when the final judgement on mr kotsaba is handed down then we can comment on it he could be completely acquitted he could get a one year suspended sentence but he has not actually been sentenced to 15 years in prison the article you link to is 7 months old and mr kotsaba has not yet been sentenced to 15 years in prison i don t recall the ft reporting much on the trial of mr sentsov before he was actually judged and sentenced so please stop with your spin and disinformation njegos the ft had no articles about sentsov either until he was sentenced do a search for his name on the ft site and there are only two hits this article and one from a week ago on the estonian agent that was jailed mentioning other similar trials currently underway in russia if you don t like the ft then one wonders why you read it other than just to spew your political beliefs in the comments threads perhaps you should just abandon the ft and only read the incredibly unbiased completely accurate and not at all censored russian media actually tony blair has met hamas more than i have and he has now been criticised for that by the palestinian authority because they say he is acting on behalf of israel in trying to do a deal with hamas in gaza interesting times in which we live are they not not that i want to defend tony blair in any way but the reason he was meeting with hamas people is because he was the representative of the quartet eu un us russia on the middle east he wasn t going off meeting hamas officials because he believed in their struggle as jeremy corbyn did bird brain you mean giving people the right to buy their flat from the owner yeah sounds like a fantastic idea so property owners of decent accommodation will be forced to sell meaning that many will pull out of the rental market impacting the property market as a whole and leaving only the nastier property for rent or those nasty landlords who rent out truly atrocious housing will find an easy way to get rid of it to poor people who can t afford anything better and will be trapped in property they in turn will have trouble selling all backed by public money yes all very reasonable nigel shipman he sounds just like alexis tsipras in the minds of his followers before he became prime minister i think we can be absolutely sure that jeremy s programme will definitely not be a winning strategy in 2020 even if you have made him out to be absolutely fantastic in every way and with no flaws whatsoever in your points 1 10 ric no one is claiming that putin is about to be toppled by angry russian mobs ric so stop fabricating ric nope it s not what some people are saying is that the russian economy is hitting some turbulence and this will lead to rising criticism of putin as happens to governments in every country when the economy is vulnerable so stop caricaturing as a way of undermining any criticism of your darling putin njegos you mean by laying claim to the russian islands of etorofu maljoffre you mean like russia as if you care about the people of syria especially these ones who oppose your leader s client bahiano i ve had pending on my comments on two three occasions especially at weekends i just see it as a comment overload especially at weekends when there aren t many moderators or tech staff there was also one occasion when i recalled a word that john major used for the eurosceptics back in the 90s and was put on pending the comments eventually appeared and even if they hadn t i wouldn t consider giving up my subscription for that the ft might even be more enjoyable if it blocked all comments pathetic response as usual i do love these purely parisian problems amaq the isis news agency said on twitter why is the isis news agency even on twitter the moderate rebels with us weapons are fighting isis politiks yeah i was just reading about the clinton money raiser that s going to be held in justin timberlake s house with a whole bunch of luminaries so as for the so called msm questioning the clinton foundation this is just them trying to find something critical to say about hillary so it doesn t sound as though they re being critical only of trump it s unavoidable to be critical of him hillary s health is fine we all know that stupid claim is another desperate trump line to throw something else at her since all his other attacks fail given their stupidity but to be honest the fact that trump s campaign seems to have been run by a man with links to kremlin spies is a far more pertinent issue than which celebs are rooting for hillary since most of the population of syria hates assad it s hard to see how he could remain as president even with russia s military help russia might imagine it s expanding its influence in the region by allowing the killing to go on and to participate in it until they think they can get the political situation they want but be allowing the country to be destroyed just to keep their political patron in power they have turned the syrian people against russia there are thousands of omran daqneeshes all over syria every day and even less cute children men women and elderly yet no one seems to care about them or even about omran if we re honest gac do you complain when the visegrad 4 meet what a straw man argument as usual from tony barber no one s arguing for a superstate or further centralisation of powers and no one ever has the eu was certainly not founded on the basis of anything spinelli said but for some europeans he is a valuable thinker and that s fine it s good to have diverse intellectual traditions the point isn t his and rossi s manifesto but the idea of a europe unified in solidarity as a counterpart to its dark history a cry from the middle of the second world war from prisoners of a fascist regime europe as an ideal to work towards as for poland the fifth largest eu state now that the uk is on the way out it is pushing for the opposite the repatriation of certain eu powers to memberstates the current polish government simply wants to repatriate so called powers such as what is believes should be its right to persecute the opposition and control the media and courts dean armond the eu isn t in any greater crisis than what the general early 21st century context has brought the world as a whole and britain s vote to leave has certainly not brought any crisis on at all merkel didn t invite any migrants she said that germany could take on the bulk of the refugees who had ended up in europe and is also attempting to get a system in place so that those fleeing from the horrific mess in syria don t have to drown in the aegean sea to get refuge but can be processed in turkey while also helping turkey look after the majority greece and syriza in particular despite having opposed merkel over the bailout is very much in agreement with her on this issue greece isn t erecting any barriers and finds the ones other countries are attempting to put up distasteful in fact just yesterday the prime minister of greece was saying how important turkey s role is in keeping the refugee flows down they are frustrated by neighbouring countries who talk about islands to dump the migrants because this effectively means leaving them all in greece as for other countries who oppose migrants the funny thing is that countries like hungary and slovakia have a desperate shortage of workers and sorely need migrants but because their current governments are comprised of racists and bigots they refuse to make use of the syrian refugees so their economies are suffering but it s ok they get loads of eu money to keep them going why do brexiteers think that we are in an after brexit period is it because they think that the uk being outside of the eu won t be much different than being in just wait until the uk is really out petr hanak prague cz are slovak workers in the uk migrants do you believe that afghans and syrians are all brutes who are unable to do simple tasks slovakia needs unskilled farm labour for example because even there the young aren t willing to do that kind of job anymore where i work there are plenty of migrants and even some refugees from earlier wars no syrians yet though but that wouldn t be a problem perhaps you should abandon the daft stereotype you have in your mind that muslims can t do western jobs could you please tell me just which non eu guest workers are going to want to go and work in hungary as the hungarian government is trying to achieve http hungarytoday hu news economy minister hungary bring non eu guest workers ease shortage labour 74532ironically the first immigrant to hungary i ve personally heard of a few years ago now before the current government was an iranian carpet seller with the climate the current government are fostering i ll doubt they ll get many migrants the best strongest and most resilient economies are those which are open and based in societies that are cultural open and appreciate diversity that was the uk s strong point although it seems that might be being thrown out of the window now and all so we re told because there are too many eastern europeans in britain today petr hanak prague cz sure because the czech republic is making such a great contribution to the eu you certainly couldn t accuse it of taking but never giving maljoffre too right it s outrageous that in the us journalists asking difficult questions and opposition politicians are shot and killed sometimes in the shadow of the white house oh sorry wrong superpower if the term can be used for russia maljoffre the mantra is simple literally russian elections fixed our elections fair and balanced just ask the dnc well according to zeus this was a great article you guys obviously didn t get the same memo this morning yeah the democratic primaries were so rigged all those democrat supporters really wanted to vote for the non democrat but they were prevented by the cunning dnc and hillary is ill isn t she isn t that the latest line the memos are pushing also she and obama founded isis together didn t they maljoffre what i actually say is whereabouts in europe are you from again i also say to your comparison of the democrats with north korea ha ha ha kinda ridiculous can you outline exactly what using facts not vague insinuations what the dnc did wrong like actual things not she s corrupt like you re political leader trump does by the way a party s process for selecting its candidate is not the same an election to political office i also say favouring while you say favoring whereabouts in europe are you from again the zeus sure it s embarrassing to have a few emails pulled out here and there context less and with only the juicy bits thrown out i m sure if that happened to you you d be embarrassed too dws term was over anyway in a few months but she s still beating sanders chosen candidate in florida but americans have moved on from the pseudo revelations and are pointing the finger at russia for the hack and this has rebounded on russia which is accused of interfering in another country s election even edward snowden says russia s behind it now can you explain why your dear leader is hacking the servers of political parties in other countries and throwing out a few decontextualised posts in an attempt to sway the us election the zeus i agree an interesting article exposing how putin aims to control the democratic process and ensure that the only election result possible is the one he wants maljoffre yeah how weird the dnc slightly favouring but not much really the candidate who s been a democrat for nearly 50 years as opposed to the one who only joined last year and that only as a route to standing for the presidency not out of conviction and those over 3 million extra votes that the actual democrat won over the non democrat were all the result of a rigged election right just like when the democrat wins the presidency as opposed to your political hero trump it s going to be because the election was rigged right whereabouts in europe are you from again the zeus snowden seems to believe that russia is behind the dnc hack who do you think it is and don t you see that the bigger story is the hack not some random comments an attempted coup initiated by the notorious fethullah gulen terrorist organization feto is there any evidence for this whatsoever if so please present it to the world before asking us to condemn feto the fact that the turkish government has not presented any such information thus far and neither does this letter only leads to the conclusion that they are lying about that yes the coup was an attack on turkish democracy but so is what erdogan is attempting now given turkey s strong place and active role within the anti daesh coalition is this a joke regarding the normalisation between turkey and russia we are pleased to see that our efforts for de escalation and dialogue are paying off ooh we re so scared by this veiled threat ending your letter with such nonsense only underlines how idiotic the turkish government and its representatives are pathetic ambassador pathetic by the way has putin condemned gulen brummie that s a lot of dollars to the rouble he looks delighted hardtruth more difficult for the uk to do this on its own outside the eu although it will be easier for the eu to react to chinese abuses without the uk trying to block it all the time sounds great paul munton s potimarron i doubt trump would sue for libel more interesting is the connection between assange and the russians old granddad 100 what s often not mentioned is that many of the attacks on the armenians 100 years ago were committed by kurds mr kiplagat maybe the reason they re asking turkey to provide evidence is that none exists why would this complicate the refugee deal with the eu surely it would make it easier hopefully this along with the restoration of relations with israel signals that some kind of common sense is being restored in the world of erdogan yet the likelihood is that the cdu which is currently actually in opposition in baden w rttemberg which is run by the spd greens will form the state government in a cdu green coalition what a bizarre statement considering that the refugees are fleeing in droves right now with assad as leader even more bizarre the idea that the old conditions could simply be restored and everything would be able to return to the alleged wonderful prosperity and order the syrians apparently had before sorry michael ignatieff but it s because of that illegal evil war against iraq based on lies and delusion which you wholeheartedly supported that it s now so difficult for the us and the west in general to carve out a response to the problems of the middle east again it has to be said what does the european court of human rights aka a strasbourg court have to do with the eu kiril is not the ecumenical patriarch so cannot decide things for orthodox christians the church he heads was small and obscure a millennium ago this is a completely different article from the one i commented on yesterday interesting article from 2008 showing what fyodor lukyanov s really about http www theguardian com commentisfree 2008 sep 19 russia natohe bashes the us for supposedly trying to be a hegemon and then talks of the desire of a strengthened russia to discuss spheres of interests as if spheres of influence aren t a colonial legacy where russia wants to play hegemon to the countries it believes it should control this is what s really behind moscow s willingness to destroy syria by propping up assad to show its strength and defend what it believes is its sphere of influence but just as through his show of strength and desire to exert his influence putin has lost the people of ukraine he has lost the people of syria too along with tens of millions of arabs and sunni muslims in other countries what fyodor lukyanov is really trying to say is that assad must be supported all those who oppose him are isis terrorists and the hundreds of thousands of syrian civilians being bombed maimed and displaced by russian air strikes and assad s attacks are either too irrelevant to be considered or isis terrorists who deserve it anyway it will take at least one more round of hostilities before dialogue can be resumed and this round of hostilities will last until 1 march moscow s proposed date for the start of a ceasefire by which time russian air strikes backing up assad s army will have wrought enough destruction to the civilian population and infrastructure so they hope to bring their opponents to their knees indeed this is exactly the sort of thinking fyodor lukyanov expresses here a war is just a way to strengthen one s positions in negotiations as long as one side believes it can attain its goal albeit not a complete victory by force it will keep using it a real political process begins when it becomes clear that armed actions can no longer change the situation russia will keep bombing until it thinks it s in a position to impose its will in negotiations but he s wrong even if putin and assad manage to impose their own vision of a settlement they have lost the vast majority of the syrian people there will be no syria left there is almost no one for assad to be president over by destroying his country to keep his grip on power assad has ensured that the largest part of his population at least no longer regard him as legitimate and the hostilities won t cease as isis is still there by crushing any kind of moderate opposition assad and putin are only ensuring that for those millions of syrians who have been damaged by assad isis is the only alternative as others have pointed out the headline and opening sentence are a load of tosh the schism took place between the eastern orthodox patriarchate in constantinople and the church in rome the russian church has nothing to do with that and was barely existent at the time popes and ecumenical patriarchs have definitely met since then francis himself met the current patriarch bartholomew i in istanbul seat of the constantinople patriarchate over a year ago in any case no schism will be repaired no one particularly wants it too and it doesn t actually matter this is probably not the place but since this article touches on the ft s future plans i d just like to say that your new mobile site is absolutely horrible and i now never read the ft on it which means i spend significantly less time a day with the ft konstantin because he s irrelevant to the building of a reformed and globalised world that can face the new challenges and has made russia such as well trevigiano he would be rubbish gulliver there is no such thing as uk football since you don t know such a basic fact presumably you re only interest in commenting on this thread was to make racist anti muslim comments so he s the half brother of the king of jordan if someone is accused of committing especially serious crimes it does not matter where he is hiding in russia or abroad even in antarctica we are simply obliged to take all legal measures to bring him to justice mr markin said two words andrey lugovoy maljoffre yes it s all a conspiracy the fact that putin does indeed look like that is neither here nor there perhaps you would have preferred a photo of khodorkovsky in his prison uniform paperclip it s not about surviving it s about having a decent standard of living and good prospects for the future can that be said of russia today or perhaps this is why putin constantly uses bellicose language to make the populous feel they re under constant attack from an external threat so they don t overlook the fact that their country s economy isn t actually doing well last month lord coe severed ties with the sports company nike after allegations that he had lobbied for the company s home town to be awarded the 2021 athletics world championships eugene isn t nike s home town but it s near enough and is in nike s home state despite the scandals lord coe said he did not accept there was a widespread culture of cheating in athletics the iaaf was not a corrupt organisation he insisted and athletes blood data should not be made public when he says things like this he only raises more questions about himself the nike oregon project and alberto salazar must be looked into and not by sebastian coe christopher c chechens are busy fighting in syria paid by their best friends putin exaltabor but then we d also have to investigate just how russia managed to secure both the world cup and socchi olympics we d also have to investigate every single major sporting event that s happened in the past 20 years and is due to happen in the next five because i don t doubt for a second that similar payments were made in many of those cases but that bears absolutely no relation to the reason why russia has been banned from the olympics so far if they get their act together they may get back in it was the russian state that was complicit in a wide scale doping programme not an independent federation or private individuals getting getting or receiving bribes that have no effect on the results of the competitions the other difference is that it was the german media that revealed this payment i doubt very much that any russian media would have been able to make revelations about the huge state run athletics doping programme in their country but why expect russian trolls to comprehend any of that what a great pair what about putin s eurasian economic union that has turned out to be a total flop and turned the ukrainians against russia which was trying to trap them in it on the other hand juncker last week proposed the eu develop relations with the eurasian union or what there is of it which is an interesting proposal the eurasian union s best prospects lie in working to have good relations with the european union of course there are losers a deal that entrenches president bashar al assad in syria will infuriate the saudis what the saudis think isn t important but the real losers of a deal that entrenches president bashar al assad in syria will be the syrian people and syria itself after all his rule over the country so far has been disastrous i think even the russians now realise that they can t prop up assad forever but their attempts at influence in a post transition syria will be limited by the fact that they are not trusted by the millions of syrians who are assad s victims as part of the reset it seems certain that gazprom will come to terms over the anti trust case being brought by the european commission and will accept some modest and mostly cosmetic adjustments to its trading arrangements an important and oft ignored point if these adjustments were so modest and cosmetic one wonders why putin didn t agree to them earlier but instead made a hash of things with south stream and his even more disastrous alternative effort of turkish stream christopher c what do you wonder about their strategy against russia any ideas how much that schweppes can cost rb8273 do you understand the difference between fewer and less ']"
